            <description>Save money on the purchase and in the long run.



                In the smart home era, most people associate Philips with its incredibly popular Hue bulbs, but the company still makes some of the best regular bulbs on the market. Philips bulbs are some of the best you can buy, and right now there are a bunch of varieties on sale at Amazon. This 4-pack of non-dimmable 1500 Lumen LED bulbs is down to $15.95 from a regular price of just over $20, and this 16-pack of 800 Lumen bulbs is only $21.60, which is about $8 less than it normally sells for.

                If you need candelabra bulbs, this 12-pack of dimmable bulbs is only $21.38, a savings of around $5. There are a few other options available at discounted prices right now as well so be sure to check them all out.

            <title>Here's what you'll be able to do with Google Assistant's six Routines</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/q5qvaryDlQY/heres-what-youll-be-able-do-google-assistants-six-routines</link>
            <description>The Assistant's about to get a lot more powerful.

                Google's been talking about its Routines feature for Google Assistant since October of last year, but it's been pretty hush-hush in regards to how exactly users will interact with them and how much they can or can't be customized. Thanks to a support page that Google recently published, we now have the full scoop on what Routines will be available and how they'll work.



                Originally spotted by our friends at Android Police, the support page reveals that users will have six Routines to choose from, including Good morning, Bedtime, Leaving home, I'm home, Commuting to work, and Commuting home.

                Routines will allow you to say one command/hot word to trigger the Assistant to perform a variety of different actions, and without further ado, here's a quick breakdown of what each one will do:

                Good morning

            <description>Charge more gear on the go.



                Car chargers are a great way to keep your phone or GPS powered up during road trips, but what about trying to get added power to your DSLR or computer? This Aukey 300W power inverter is a perfect way to do just that, and today you can pick one up for just $13.24 when you use coupon code Y6G4BUVX. It normally sells for $24.99 and has only dropped to $20 via a direct drop in the past.

                This adds two AC outlets to your car, allowing you to power devices with regular wall plugs instead of just using a USB cable. It provides an output of 300W of continuous power, and it can even jumpstart your car should you find yourself in a situation where it simply won't crank over.

                See at Amazon

            <title>Vivo announces 'Super HDR' that uses AI for better smartphone pictures</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/LMBTSJ76hNg/vivo-announces-super-hdr-uses-ai-better-images</link>
            <description>The new tech has a dynamic range up to 14 EV.

                Vivo's been experimenting with a lot of cutting-edge technology this year with phones like the X20 Plus UD and Apex, and it's shifting its focus on photography with the recent announcement of its new "Super HDR" platform.



                Super HDR is supposed to be an upgrade over the current HDR shooting modes found in most smartphone cameras these days, and to do this, Vivo says it's harnessing the power of AI. Super HDR works in a very similar fashion compared to regular HDR, but because of its ability to reach a 14 exposure value and capture up to 12 frames with just one press of a shutter button, Vivo has a lot more data to work with to create crisper, brighter images.

                Vivo is touting five main advantages for Super HDR, and they include the following:

                Capture more detail in adverse shooting environments, such as low-light and high-contrast situations
                Images have a more natural-looking contrast by using the different data found in the 12 frames t...</description>

            <title>Which Galaxy S9 color should I buy: Black, purple, blue, or gray?</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/IpDQA9LDc3o/what-color-galaxy-s9-should-you-buy</link>
            <description>

                Now, this is a big decision.

                The Galaxy S9 and S9+ have very subtle design differences compared to the Galaxy S8 and S8+, but one clear way to recognize them at a glance are their new colors. Midnight Black, Lilac Purple, Coral Blue and Titanium Gray are the color options, and aside from black they're all fresh hues we haven't seen before.

                Here's a good look at all four colors, and some information on what you can expect from each one so you can make an informed decision when you go to order.

                Galaxy S9 in Midnight Black



                Samsung's been doing Midnight Black phones for a few years now, and the Galaxy S9's version is no different. This is a solid black color with no real extra shine or glimmer to it. The metal frame is now more of a gray color on account of its texturing, which differs from the high-gloss black finish on the Galaxy S8. It's very similar to the black Galaxy S7, in fact.

                Who is it for?

                If you want to play it safe, go for the Midnight Black color. It hides scratch...</description>

<p>Samsung's been doing Midnight Black phones for a few years now, and the Galaxy S9's version is no different. This is a solid black color with no real extra shine or glimmer to it. The metal frame is now more of a gray color on account of its texturing, which differs from the high-gloss black finish on the Galaxy S8. It's very similar to the black
    <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s7">Galaxy S7</a>, in fact.
</p>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>If you want to play it safe, go for the Midnight Black color. It hides scratches better than the other lighter colors, and you won't be attracting any unwanted attention to your phone. If you plan on just putting a case on your phone anyway, black is probably the easiest color to re-sell later on when you're done with the phone.</p>

<p>Lilac Purple is a brand new color for Samsung, and it kind of picks up where Orchid Gray left off in the Galaxy S8. It's far more reflective and has a deeper color to it that's more susceptible to changing its look in various lighting conditions, which means it will range from a deep purple (in dark lighting) to almost a grayish pink color (in bright light). The metal frame is a dull purple or pink, depending on the light. Of all four colors, Lilac Purple stands out the most &mdash; partially because there just aren't many purple phones out there, but also on account of its reflectivity and pink accents.</p>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>If you're looking for a stand-out phone that'll get noticed and never be confused for anyone else's at the dinner table, Lilac Purple is the color for you. It's a good bet that even among Galaxy S9 and S9+ owners that Lilac Purple will be the lowest-selling variety, so you have the best shot at staying unique for a while when you choose it.</p>

</div>
<p>Having a name like Coral Blue is a bit of a misnomer &mdash; this isn't anything like Samsung's previous blues, but more of a powder blue instead. I'd consider it a gray-based phone with some blue to it when you get it in bright lighting. When it's in darker areas, you can't tell it apart from the Titanium Gray model. The metal frame is a little bit of a giveaway with its soft blue shade, but even then it still doesn't substantially stand out. It still has some of that reflectivity that Lilac Purple does, and that's really the only time that it shows off a lot of its blue tendencies.</p>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>Coral Blue is a great balance between the simple Midnight Black and the overtly bright Lilac Purple. Most of the time it's quite simple and sleek looking, but in the right light it can show off its reflections and look far more blue. Coral Blue is a handsome, sophisticated color that you can't go wrong with.</p>
<h2>Galaxy S9 in Titanium Gray</h2>

    </div>
    <!--/media-gallery-flat-->
</div>
<p>Titanium Gray is a simple color, without much of the color-shifting tendencies seen in Lilac Purple and Coral Blue. It's just gray, and when you get it in brighter or darker lighting, it just looks a bit closer to white and a bit closer to black. In the right lighting, it'll look identical to Coral Blue. The metal frame is just a pure gray that looks like the most natural metal color, giving it more of an industrial look than the other three.</p>
<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>Titanium Gray won't be available in the U.S., so strike it off of your list if you're buying it there. But if you have the choice, give it a look if you don't want Midnight Black but aren't interested in the shimmering color-changing feature of Lilac Purple or Coral Blue. Gray will always be gray no matter what, and if that sounds like a safe bet then you should go for it.</p>
<h2>Regional differences matter (a little less this time)</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-color-galaxy-s9-should-you-buy" title="Which Galaxy S9 color should I buy: Black, purple, blue, or gray?">
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-all-four-colors-4.jpg?itok=dhUGiEcQ">
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>As ever, not all regions are getting the same colors of the Galaxy S9 and S9+. In the U.S., we have access to three colors: black, purple and blue. As far as individual U.S. carriers go, most are offering all three colors of both sizes of the phone &mdash; but depending on which store you go to or whether you order online, stock may be limited.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, Titanium Gray is only for international markets. Around the world, you can expect two or three colors offered depending on the individual country (and carrier) you're buying in. And of course this can change over time as exclusivity deals run out and new ones are made &mdash; and there's a good chance Samsung will end up changing its color strategy over the course of the year.</p>

            <description>VR is great for immersing yourself in a virtual cinema, even if you're watching 3D videos.



                Your Gear VR can take you into a virtual space for gaming, but it's also a great way to view videos. It supports more than just flat videos. You can view 3D, 180&amp;deg;, or 360&amp;deg; videos inside the device. And while you can watch content that is stored directly on your Gear VR, sometimes you need to view video files from your PC.

                Luckily, this isn't that complicated thanks to so impressive apps. Here are the best ways to stream 3D movies from your PC to your Gear VR.



                Skybox VR



                Skybox VR is an app designed to let you stream videos from your PC to VR headsets, including the Gear VR. It works through Skybox's AirScreen functionality that requires a PC client and you having the app on your Gear VR. I can also work with a UPnP/DLNA server.

<h2>Skybox VR</h2>

    <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-stream-3d-movies-your-pc-your-gear-vr" title="How to stream 3D movies from your PC to your Gear VR">
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/skybox-all-files.jpg?itok=7K92_bzy">

    <p>Skybox VR is an app designed to let you stream videos from your PC to VR headsets, including the Gear VR. It works through Skybox's AirScreen functionality that requires a PC client and you having the app on your Gear VR. I can also work with a UPnP/DLNA server.</p>
    <p>You have to have both of your devices on the same wireless network but once it's setup on your PC and Gear VR you just use the PC client to move individual videos or entire folders into your Skybox library and can play them on your Gear VR.</p>
    <p>We
        <a href="https://www.vrheads.com/what-skybox-vr-and-how-does-it-work">looked at Skybox VR</a> back when it was in alpha testing, but it's been almost a year since then for the developers to iron out kinks and improve the app.
    </p>
    <p>With Skybox VR you can even stream the same video to multiple headsets at once so you can experience videos together. You can also use it to view 2D, 180&deg;, or 360&deg; videos.</p>
    <p>

    <h2>Using your own media server</h2>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>Another way that you can view 3D content is to play it through your own media server such as Plex, Emby, or Kodi. These are a great way to stream media to multiple devices within your home and make it easy to view different kinds of media.</p>
        <p>If you already have a media server setup, you'll have to have an app that works with it on your Gear GR. There are a few options, including Skybox mentioned above, but another good one is Pigagus.</p>
        <p>Pigasus can automatically find a media server and supports playback of 3D, 2D, 180&deg;, or 360&deg; videos.</p>

            <description>It's the 5th service to join the initiative.

                Last October, Movies Anywhere launched as a way to simplify everyone's digital movie libraries by combining your iTunes, Google Play, Prime Video, and Vudu purchases under one single app. It was a dream come true for a lot of people, and it's getting even better with support for FandangoNOW.



                Just like the other services mentioned above, you can now link your FandangoNOW account to Movies Anywhere and have all of your Fandango purchases automatically join your existing Movies Anywhere collection.

                Even if you aren't currently a big FandangoNOW user, this is still exciting news. Let's say you're in the market to buy a new movie, and FandangoNOW has the lowest price thanks to a sale it's running. Instead of buying it there and not being able to add it to the rest of your collection, you can now purchase it for the lower price and still have it live with your entire library.

            <title>Fitbit is adding menstrual cycle tracking for its female users</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/wVqhDau04rs/fitbit-adding-menstrual-cycle-tracking-its-female-users</link>
            <description>This could have a huge, positive impact on women's health.

                During Fitbit's recent press event in New York City, the company talked extensively about the new products that it'll be highlighting this coming spring. A lot of the focus was on its new Versa smartwatch and Ace fitness tracker, but Fitbit also took a good chunk of time to talk about new female health features it's working on.



                This spring, Fitbit will introduce menstrual cycle tracking for all Fitbit users that identify as female on their profile. Tracking will be available on-device for the Versa and Ionic, and right within the Fitbit app for everyone.

                Female users will have the option of adding a new female health tile to their Dashboard in the Fitbit app, and this will enable them to track their cycles, see predictions of upcoming cycles, indicate any symptoms they're experiencing, and see cycle-by-cycle metrics once enough data is recorded.


                Tracking is available on the Versa, Ionic, and Fitbit app.

By tapping into all of the other data you log with Fitbit (such as steps, calories burned, heart-rate, etc.), women will be able to see any links between biometrics and their menstruation. Add that together with the fact that Fitbit already has 25.4 million active users, and there's great potential for this to have a huge impact on feminine medical research.</p><p>A Fitbit study recently revealed that 70% of women don't know the average length of their cycle, and 80% of them aren't aware of how many phases are in a cycle. By enabling its millions of female users to log all of this data, Fitbit says it'll allow for research to be done in this field that hasn't been obtainable until now.</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-adding-menstrual-cycle-tracking-its-female-users" title="Fitbit is adding menstrual cycle tracking for its female users"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/fitbit-female-health-2.jpeg?itok=k4Mas-Zw"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-adding-menstrual-cycle-tracking-its-female-users" title="Fitbit is adding menstrual cycle tracking for its female users"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2018/03/fitbit-female-health-3.jpeg?itok=aLUPrz7Y"></a></p><p>As for the end user, Fitbit also notes that "having this knowledge helps women have better conversations with their doctor." When asked about their cycle during a doctor visit, women can pull out their phone, show their physician all of their data, and more accurately address concerns and pick up on red flags.</p><p>None of this directly impacts me as a 20-year-old guy, but I honestly found this to be the most interesting of all Fitbit's announcements. Having a better understanding of our body is critical to leading a healthy life, and that's exactly what Fitbit's hoping to achieve here.</p><p>If you're a female, what do you think about this?

            <title>The Fitbit Ace is Fitbit's first fitness tracker for kids and costs $99</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/_yqI1hRRGfs/fitbit-ace</link>
            <description>Available in Q2 of this year.

                The Fitbit Versa is Fitbit's most prominent product in its spring lineup, but it'll also be joined by the company's first fitness tracker made specifically for kids &amp;mdash; the Fitbit Ace.



                The Fitbit Ace adopts the same general design found with the Fitbit Alta, meaning it's got a small digital screen on the front that's surrounded by a comfortable silicone band. The body is smaller compared to the Alta and is intended to grow with kids as they get bigger, and its waterproof design means you won't have to worry about the Ace being worn in the shower.

                You'll find 5+ days of battery life on the Ace, and it accurately tracks steps, active minutes, and sleep. Kids will get reminders to get at least 250 steps each hour, and per the recommendation of the World Health Organization for kids between 7 and 17, the Ace will encourage users to get 60 active minutes each day.

            <title>Fitbit Versa hands-on: Fitbit's finally getting serious about smartwatches</title>

            <description>The Versa ditches GPS and NFC for a $199 price tag.

                I've been wearing a Fitbit Ionic since January, and it's quickly become one of my favorite smartwatches. I like the way it looks, it keeps me motivated to stay active, and its feature-set works great for what I want in a wearable. Unfortunately, most everyone else doesn't feel the same way.



                Fitbit reported less-than-favorable sales for the Ionic during its latest earnings call, and along with this, promised investors it was working on a new "mass appeal" smartwatch that would draw in more customers. A couple leaks gave us a good idea as to what this gadget would bring to the table, but now we officially know what's going on.

                Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Fitbit Versa.

                The Fitbit Versa is a very different-looking watch compared to the Ionic, and I think most people will agree that all of the changes here have been made for the better. Fitbit says the Versa is the "lightest metal smartwatch you can buy in the U.S.", and while I n...</description>

However, you'll find a lot more features and polish thanks to the 2.0 update that's live on the Versa out of the box. The Ionic will receive a free update that brings all of the new software features found on the Versa, and there's a lot of great stuff to be found.</p><p>First and foremost, Fitbit's <em>finally</em> letting you reply to texts. You'll be able to choose from five pre-made responses, and you can customize these to say whatever you'd like (up to 60 characters per response). The inability to interact with text messages is one of my biggest annoyances on the Ionic, so it's great to see Fitbit adding it.

            <description>With the Versa and an all-new development tool, Fibit's finally getting serious about its smartwatch game.

                While the Versa was the highlight of Fitbit's recent press event in New York City, the company had another big announcement that should make FitbitOS's future a lot brighter &amp;mdash; a brand-new development simulator.



                Fitbit's been marketing FitbitOS (the operating system that powers the Versa and Ionic) as an easy-to-use platform for creating apps/watch faces, and to its credit, it's already one of the simplest systems out there. Software for FitbitOS is built using JavaScript, CSS, and SVG, and according to Fitbit Developer Advocates, Jon Barlow and Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Harper, the barrier of entry for developers to start creating apps is far lower compared to Android Wear, Apple's watchOS, and even Tizen for Samsung's Gear wearables.

                There are currently 13,368 developers working on FitbitOS, and at the time of publication, more than 500 apps/clock faces have been created ...</description>

That number's smaller than what competing wearable platforms offer, but considering that the FitbitOS SDK just launched this past September, that's considerable growth over less than six months.</p><blockquote class="pull right big"><p>13,368 developers have created 500+ apps/watch faces.</p></blockquote><p>Here's the thing though, as open as Fitbit's wanted its SDK to be, there's been one caveat holding some devs at bay. Up until now, it's been required that you own a device powered by FitbitOS to run your apps to see what your hard work looks like as a finished product. Thanks to the new simulator, however, developers will be able to compile and run their apps and clock faces on a virtual Ionic or Versa.</p><p>In other words, it's now possible to build and adequately test any apps you're creating without the need for any hardware.</p><p>I had a chance to go hands-on with Fitbit's simulator, and even for someone like myself with insufficient background in coding, using it with the Fitbit SDK was incredibly simple.</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-development-simulator" title="Fitbit's new development simulator makes it easier than ever to create apps for FitbitOS"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/fitbit-studio-select-template.jpg?itok=CNPHzLKE"></a></p><p>The process starts by going to studio.fitbit.com. After logging in with your Fitbit credentials, you're able to begin a new project. Fitbit has some different templates to play around with, and after selecting the one you'd like (I went with the Digital Clock), you're all set to get coding.</p><p>All of your main components are organized on the left-hand side by category, making it easy to see your primary JavaScript code, CSS workspace for changing up the look of your app, two tabs for the UI, and a Package tab that lets you request various permissions and choose which languages you want to be supported. You can delete and edit these workspaces as you'd like, and all of this is done right through your web browser.</p><p>Once you've got your app built and want to see how it looks like on the Ionic or Versa, this is where the simulator comes into play.</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-development-simulator" title="Fitbit's new development simulator makes it easier than ever to create apps for FitbitOS"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/fitbit-simulator-and-studio.jpg?itok=wuC4DKYF"></a></p><p>Fitbit's offering the simulator as a free download for Windows and macOS, and once it's downloaded and installed onto your machine, opening it will show a virtual Ionic. Once this is open, go back to Fitbit Studio, click "Select Device," and the Ionic simulator should automatically pop up. Select it, click the Run button, and you'll instantly see your creation pop up on the simulator.</p><p>You can control your app by interacting with the virtual Ionic's touchscreen with your mouse, and you can even bring up a virtual representation of the Versa to see how your creation will look on it, too. If you make a few edits to your app after seeing it on the simulator, updating it with your current code is as easy as clicking the run button again.</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-development-simulator" title="Fitbit's new development simulator makes it easier than ever to create apps for FitbitOS"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/fitbit-simulator-ionic%20cropped.jpg?itok=EvNxCgZZ"></a><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fitbit-development-simulator" title="Fitbit's new development simulator makes it easier than ever to create apps for FitbitOS"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/03/fitbit-simulator-versa%20cropped.jpg?itok=TIAuZqZJ"></a></p><p>Once you're happy with the result, you can share your app with anyone via a private link or submit it to the Fitbit Gallery so it'll be available for public download. Fitbit says all submitted apps are reviewed within 48 hours and are tested to ensure everything works the way it's supposed to.</p><p>Jon Barlow was creating apps for Pebble before the Fitbit acquisition, and while the transition process was smooth on a technical level, something he said has also remained intact is the strong community support that made so many people fall in love with Pebble in the first place. Barlow says community members often help one another out with any problems or questions that arise through the forums and social media, and this human touch is something Fitbit's quite proud of.</p><p>While none of this is directly impacting consumers, it's a big step in the right direction to open up FitbitOS development for anyone that wants to test the SDK's waters. It's still awfully early days for the operating system, but with the simulator in place and the Versa being a more appealing option to general consumers, Fitbit's in the best position possible to have a serious impact on the wearable market.</p></div></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androidcentral/~4/Xwr1zQkQIvY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>]]>

            <title>Should you get the Huawei Mate 10 Pro instead of the Galaxy Note 8?</title>

            <description>Big phone showdown.

                No matter how involved you are in the smartphone world, chances are you've heard of the Galaxy Note 8. Samsung's Note line has become iconic for its large, beautiful displays, bleeding-edge technology, and the wondrous S Pen, and the Note 8 keeps this tradition alive and well.



                We came away quite pleased with the Note 8 during our initial review, but since then, another big smartphone has entered the ring with the hopes of knocking the Note slightly off its pedestal. That phone is the Huawei Mate 10 Pro.

                Huawei's had a difficult time making a big impression on the U.S. market, but even so, there are still some consumers that are interested in ditching the Note 8 for the Mate 10 Pro.

                When one Note 8 owner asked if they should make the jump, this is how some of our forum users responded.

I had one for 2months for review and it was a lovely device. I had it along side my daily phone which is a Galaxy Note8 to.

The Mate10 Pro is a lot more compact and much more ergonomic than the Note8.

            <title>OPPO F7 is the latest Android phone to sport the notch</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/GKQJIXAs3dA/oppo-f7-latest-android-phone-sport-notch</link>
            <description>OPPO shows off the F7 ahead of its official launch in India on March 26.



                ASUS demoed the ZenFone 5 late last month, and the main thing that stood out about the phone is the iPhone X-like notch. It was only a matter of time before other manufacturers offered their own take on the notch, and today OPPO is doing just that with the F7. The successor to the F5 is set to launch in India later this month, and as you can see from the teaser image, the phone will sport a cutout where the front camera is housed.

                The OPPO F7 features a 6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2280x1080. We've seen 18:9 panels go mainstream over the course of the last year, and it looks like that'll be the case with 19:9 panels this year, with the added pixels to accommodate the notch. The phone comes with an 89.09% screen-to-body ratio, and you also get gestures that allow you to navigate between apps.



                Like previous devices, a key area of focus with the OPPO F7 is the selfie camera, with the phone featuring a...</description>

We've seen 18:9 panels go mainstream over the course of the last year, and it looks like that'll be the case with 19:9 panels this year, with the added pixels to accommodate the notch. The phone comes with an 89.09% screen-to-body ratio, and you also get gestures that allow you to navigate between apps.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Like previous devices, a key area of focus with the OPPO F7 is the selfie camera, with the phone featuring a 25MP camera at the front. OPPO introduced an AI-based Beauty Recognition feature late last year
    <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-f5-ditches-bezels-picks-20mp-front-camera-ai">in the F5</a>, and the F7 introduces AI Beauty 2.0 with "differentiated beautification touches for different people, e.g. male or female, in a group photo."
</p>
<p>The AI learns your preferences over time &mdash; based on edits you make to your photos &mdash; and automatically applies those effects for subsequent shots. The company is also touting additional improvements to the front shooter, including HDR and AR stickers.</p>
<p>The OPPO F7 is slated to make its debut in India on March 26, which is when we'll know more about the specs and pricing. What do you guys make of the design of OPPO's upcoming phone?</p>

            <title>Honor 9 Lite vs. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5: Which should you buy?</title>

            <description>Both the Honor 9 Lite and Redmi Note 5 offer a compelling set of features for under $200.



                Honor has rolled out budget phones at a steady clip over the last two years, and the Honor 9 Lite is the latest addition to its portfolio. The phone made its debut in China at the end of last year, and went on sale in India followed by a launch in Europe last month. Available for &amp;pound;199 ($275) in the UK and &amp;#8377;10,999 ($170) in India, the Honor 9 Lite ticks a lot of boxes: it has an 18:9 panel, comes with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, and features a total of four cameras.

                The Redmi Note 5 is no slouch either &amp;mdash; Xiaomi decided to stick with the same internal hardware as last year, but introduced an 18:9 panel and lowered the price point to &amp;#8377;9,999 ($153), making it a real bargain. With two great options on offer at the same price, it's time to find out which phone to pick.

The phone made its debut in China at the end of last year, and went on sale in India followed by a launch in Europe last month. Available for &pound;199 ($275) in the UK and &#8377;10,999 ($170) in India, the Honor 9 Lite ticks a lot of boxes: it has an 18:9 panel, comes with<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oreo">Android 8.0 Oreo</a> out of the box, and features a total of<em>four</em> cameras.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-review">Redmi Note 5</a> is no slouch either &mdash; Xiaomi decided to stick with the same internal hardware as last year, but introduced an 18:9 panel and lowered the price point to &#8377;9,999 ($153), making it a real bargain. With two great options on offer at the same price, it's time to find out which phone to pick.</p><h2>What the <em>Honor 9 Lite</em> does better</h2><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/honor-9-lite-vs-xiaomi-redmi-note-5" title="Honor 9 Lite vs. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5: Which should you buy?"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/honor-9-lite-2.jpg?itok=9omN4rvT"></a></p><p>Of the two phones, the Honor 9 Lite has the better design. The 2.5D curved glass at the back has a mirror finish, and it looks striking &mdash; even more so when light reflects off it. The blue color option in particular looks gorgeous, and there's no denying the fact that this is one of the better-looking phones in the budget segment.</p><p>There's similar 2.5D glass up front, which when combined with the rounded corners makes it easy to grip the device. 18:9 panels in general are unwieldy because of the tall nature of the display, and that's the case with the Honor 9 Lite as well. The 5.65-inch panel comes in at 151mm, which is less than the 158mm height of the 5.99-inch display of the Redmi Note 5, but one-handed usage is going to be a stretch unless you have huge hands.</p><blockquote class="big pull left"><p>The Honor 9 Lite is one of the better-looking budget phones out there.</p></blockquote><p>Thankfully, you can enable fingerprint sensor gestures to pull down the notification shade. The phone is particularly light at 149g, or 31g less than the Redmi Note 5. That's because of the smaller battery and the fact that the mid-frame is made out of plastic and not aluminum. Nevertheless, it sports a metallic finish, and the device overall has top-notch build quality.</p><p>The Honor 9 Lite also wins out when it comes to the software side of things, as the device runs EMUI 8 based on <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oreo">Android 8.0 Oreo</a> out of the box. The Redmi Note 5 is still running<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nougat">Android 7.1.1 Nougat</a>, and there's no mention of when the device will pick up Oreo.</p><p>The key difference between the variant on sale in India and the model available in Europe is that the latter comes with NFC, enabling Google Pay compatibility in the UK.</p><p><a href="https://www.flipkart.com/honor-9-lite-midnight-black-32-gb/p/itmff5zgdeckztpk?affid=affiliate337&amp;affExtParam1=dac&amp;affExtParam2=UUacUdUnU66153YYr&amp;m1k=UUacUdUnU66153YYr" title="" class="cta shop" rel="nofollow">See at Flipkart</a></p><h2>What the <em>Redmi Note 5</em> does better</h2><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/honor-9-lite-vs-xiaomi-redmi-note-5" title="Honor 9 Lite vs. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5: Which should you buy?"><img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/02/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-17.jpg?itok=VW4cXoyG"></a></p><p>The main thing in the Redmi Note 5's favor is battery life. Sporting a 4000mAh battery under the hood, the phone offers two days' of battery life on a full charge, significantly more than what the Honor 9 Lite manages.</p><blockquote class="big pull right"><p>The Redmi Note 5 is a battery monster.</p></blockquote><p>On average, you'll get over nine hours' worth of screen-on-time between charges, so if battery life is a priority for you, then the Redmi Note 5 is the device to get.</p><p>The phone also has one of the best 18:9 panels in this category, and the screen itself isn't as reflective as the Honor 9 Lite. Sunlight legibility is also better on the Redmi Note 5, particularly in harsh climes like India.</p><p><a href="https://www.flipkart.com/redmi-note-5-blue-32-gb/p/itmf2fc3r2stphad?pid=MOBF28FTCDFR7VYZ&amp;affid=affiliate337&amp;affExtParam1=dac&amp;affExtParam2=UUacUdUnU66153YYr&amp;m1k=UUacUdUnU66153YYr" title="" class="cta shop" rel="nofollow">See at Flipkart</a></p><h2>Which should you buy?</h2><p>If you're in the UK, the Honor 9 Lite is a solid option, particularly considering it comes with NFC and Oreo out of the box. For &pound;199, there aren't many phones that offer quite as much as the Honor 9 Lite.</p><p>But if you're in the market for a new budget phone in India, there are better alternatives available. The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-pro-review">Redmi Note 5 Pro</a>, for instance, is available<a href="https://www.flipkart.com/redmi-note-5-pro-lake-blue-64-gb/p/itmf2fc3zb8kxsa2?pid=MOBF2BSGFKFKVQMC&amp;affid=affiliate337&amp;affExtParam1=dac&amp;affExtParam2=UUacUdUnU66153YYr&amp;m1k=UUacUdUnU66153YYr" title="" rel="nofollow">for &#8377;13,999</a> ($215), and handily beats the Honor 9 Lite in every area.</p><p>The Redmi Note 5 Pro comes with a Snapdragon 636 chipset, a 4000mAh battery, and a 12MP camera at the back that's currently the best in this category. You also get 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage as standard, and the same variant of the Honor 9 Lite will set you back &#8377;14,999 ($230). The Redmi Note 5 is pretty great for &#8377;10,999, but the Redmi Note 5 Pro trounces it in terms of value.</p><p><a href="https://www.flipkart.com/redmi-note-5-pro-lake-blue-64-gb/p/itmf2fc3zb8kxsa2?pid=MOBF2BSGFKFKVQMC&amp;affid=affiliate337&amp;affExtParam1=dac&amp;affExtParam2=UUacUdUnU66153YYr&amp;m1k=UUacUdUnU66153YYr" title="" class="cta shop" rel="nofollow">See at Flipkart</a></p></div></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androidcentral/~4/NqXShWsSTp8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>]]>

            <title>President Trump preemptively blocks Broadcom's Qualcomm takeover, citing national security concerns</title>

            <description>This one is finally settled.

                The seemingly never-ending saga of Broadcom's attempted takeover of Qualcomm has all-but-ended, as President Trump today issued an order that the deal will not be allowed to go through under the assertion that it would be a threat to U.S. national security. Broadcom is primarily a Singapore-based company, but operates globally. Qualcomm and Broadcom have been dancing around the details of a potential merger or takeover for several months, but in recent weeks had clearly been nearing a deal as Broadcom finalizes moving its headquarters to the U.S.



                There's a ton of required legal-speak in here, but it's very clear that the executive branch is not interested in this type of deal going through in any form, and no representatives of Broadcom are to be allowed to be on the Board of Directors at Qualcomm:

Those actions were also taken in the name of "national security" concerns.</p><p>It can easily be argued (and I'm happy to make the argument, personally) that the Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm would not improve products or innovation in the wide variety of technologies that they both produce. The takeover could reduce competition and potentially jeopardize some of Qualcomm's large U.S.-based operations, but none of those reasons are being cited as part of this order. Of all the reasons for this deal to be stopped, "national security" seems the least scrupulous.</p></div></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androidcentral/~4/FheNF5mC5ec" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>]]>

            <title>Apple to acquire magazine subscription app Texture, future of Android app unknown</title>

            <description>It's official &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;magazine app Texture is joining team Apple.

                Apple announced in a press release today that it has officially signed an agreement to acquire digital magazine service Texture. Texture (formerly known as Next Issue) offers users an option to pay a flat monthly fee for an unlimited digital subscription to all of their favorite magazines, that they can then access from the Texture app.

                Texture was founded in 2010, and features upwards of 200 publications that you can peruse for $9.99 per month. It's basically like Netflix or Hulu, but for magazines, meaning that you not only get to read the ones you already know you like, but you may actually broaden your horizons a bit by virtually flipping through some you may have never checked out otherwise. Texture offers mags covering everything from entertainment to tech to interior design, featuring popular titles like Bon App&amp;eacute;tit, National Geographic, Rolling Stone, Wired, and People.

We are committed to quality journalism from trusted sources and allowing magazines to keep producing beautifully designed and engaging stories for users.</p></blockquote><p>Texture seems pretty stoked about the change as well &mdash; according to Next Issue Media's CEO John Loughlin, anyway:</p><blockquote><p>I'm thrilled that Next Issue Media, and its award-winning Texture app, are being acquired by Apple. The Texture team and its current owners, Cond&eacute; Nast, Hearst, Meredith, Rogers Media and KKR, could not be more pleased or excited with this development. We could not imagine a better home or future for the service.</p></blockquote><p>As of right now, Apple is offering no word on the financial terms of the acquisition. And if you already use Texture and love it as is, don't worry &mdash; there won't be any changes for now, and you can keep using the app as you always have. Though with Apple being the buyer, you have to question how long <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nim.discovery">the Android app</a> will be sticking around.</p><p>Regardless of its eventual fate, it will be a while before this deal closes and anything official happens.
