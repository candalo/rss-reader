                <![CDATA[<p>The Moto Z2 Force is Motorola&#x2019;s next flagship phone, combining a tough screen with high-end specs.&#xA0;</p><p>Moto&apos;s latest is set to arrive on November 1 in the UAE. In terms of pricing, Moto is selling the Moto Z2 Force for AED 2,699 which also includes one mod of your choice between the JBL Sound boost 2 Speaker, Moto GamePad or TurboPower.</p><h3>Cut to the chase</h3><ul ><li><strong>What is it?</strong> The next tough flagship from Motorola</li><li><strong>When is it out?</strong> November 1</li><li><strong>What will it cost?</strong> AED 2,699 with a choice of one mod</li></ul><h3>Moto Z2 Force release date and price</h3><p>While the Z2 Force has been announced in the US for some time now, it is now ready for the Middle East. Lenovo tells us that it&apos;s aiming to release on November 1 in the UAE.</p><p>Price-wise, the Moto Z2 Force is going for AED 2,699. This price includes one mod of your choice between the JBL Sound boost 2 Speaker, Moto GamePad or TurboPower.</p><p><img  id="5CyUTBhFtoXT4UXNpBN89M" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CyUTBhFtoXT4UXNpBN89M.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>Moto Z2 Force screen</h3><p>A high point of the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/moto-z-force-1323028/review">Moto Z Force</a> was its ShatterShield screen and QHD display, so we&apos;re pleased to see both of those marquee features make a return in the Z2 Force.&#xA0;</p><p>Focusing on the ShatterShield, the clumsy of us will enjoy this feature, as it&apos;s designed to prevent the screen cracking or smashing when dropped from heights of around 5 feet or less.&#xA0;</p><p>The 5.5-inch QHD (2,560 x 1,440) AMOLED display means that we&apos;ll be treated to gorgeous, crisp visuals complete with excellent contrast and colors. It also means that this phone, like the previous version, is more than ready to hop into a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-daydream-view-review">Google Daydream View</a> headset to run the gamut of the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/best-google-daydream-apps-and-games">best Google Daydream apps and games</a>.</p><p><img  id="4ek9YUFtPxVFyWFKvAVRh5" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ek9YUFtPxVFyWFKvAVRh5.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>Moto Z2 Force design</h3><p>It turns out that we had a very good idea of how the Moto Z2 Force would look before its official unveiling, as it has been confirmed to rock a slim, metal shell that&apos;s a bit thinner than last year&apos;s iteration.&#xA0;Compared to 7mm, the Z2 Force is 6mm, just a hair thicker than the original Z.</p><p>Unfortunate for all of your 3.5mm-lovers, Moto has once again opted to, well, opt-out of including that port.</p><p>The Motorola logo makes its expected return in the middle of the phone&apos;s back, while the brand new dual-lens camera makes much better use of the camera bump. Of course, the MotoMods connector has returned near the bottom just like last year&apos;s and is compatible with all old accessories.</p><p>Flipped over to its front, the home button has been revamped to fall in line with Moto&apos;s styling for 2017, which we greatly prefer from a visual and functionality perspective over the original Z Force. With this one, you&apos;ll be able to navigate using only the fingerprint sensor, in addition to waking the phone and putting it to sleep with a tap.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p><img  id="8bxexqyBkhSv3q9apy8r35" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8bxexqyBkhSv3q9apy8r35.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>Moto Z2 Force camera and battery</h3><p>On the back of the phone, you&apos;ll find two 12MP sensors that are capable of capturing increased depth of field, as well as offering a wide-angle mode that we&apos;ve found in phones like the LG V20 and LG G6.</p><p>The front of the device will feature a 5MP selfie camera that gets by with a little help from an dual CCT flash.</p><p>Motorola&apos;s camera hardware and software gets better by the year, so we&apos;re excited to give the Z2 Force a go.</p><p><img  id="nS5PaoiBvuw5qBxThhdvT6" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nS5PaoiBvuw5qBxThhdvT6.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>Moto Z2 Force OS and power</h3><p>The Moto Z2 Force will have a Snapdragon 835 chipset, along with 6GB of RAM.&#xA0;</p><p>In terms of storage, the phone will feature 64GB of storage with the option to expand that amount via microSD up to 2TB.</p><p>Like the rest of Moto&apos;s recent fleet of 2017 smartphones, its latest will &#xA0;run Android 7.1.1 Nougat out of the box with an <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/android-o-release-date">Android O</a> update planned in December.</p><p>Given the mobile platform that the Z2 Force runs on, it&apos;s capable of supporting gigabit LTE which will be enabled in a future update.</p><p>Stay tuned for the full review of the Moto Z2 Force to see if it lives up to the hype.</p>]]>

            <description>The latest addition to the Z family is mostly the same, but different in a few key ways that you need to know about.</description>

                <![CDATA[<p>Motorola has announced the Moto Z2 Play, the thinner, lighter and faster successor to the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/moto-z-play-1327411/review/">Moto Z Play</a>.</p><p>For all that has changed, there are some familiar pieces here. The design, for example, is mostly the same with its smoothed-over edges being one of the big changes. It also keeps the 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C port, which are good moves in our book.&#xA0;</p><p>Below, we&apos;ll dive into what makes the Z2 Play tick and how it differs from its predecessor and the rest of the competition.</p><h3>Cut to the chase</h3><ul ><li><strong>What is it?</strong> Moto&apos;s mid-tier, mod-compatible smartphone</li><li><strong>How much will it cost? </strong>AED 1,999 with the Moto 360 Camera</li><li><strong>When will it be out?</strong> November 1</li></ul><h3>Moto Z2 Play release date and price</h3><p>The Moto Z2 Play will be available in the UAE on November 1 at a price of AED 1,999 for the 3GB/32GB configuration . This price includes the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/moto-360-1264259/review" title="Moto 360" data-atoaf="true" >Moto 360</a> camera as well, which, separately, sells for AED 999.</p><p><img  id="n7yH3itpVMW4pUEWAKmXgg" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n7yH3itpVMW4pUEWAKmXgg.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>Moto Z2 Play features</h3><p>The new phone will come with the latest version of Android Nougat out of the box and will be powered by the Snapdragon 626 octa-core chipset. The Z2 Play in the UAE will sell with a configuration of 4GB and 64GB of internal storage.</p><p>Compared to its predecessor, it&#x2019;s a full millimeter thinner at 5.99mm, bringing it closer to the ultra-thin status of the 5mm-thin <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/moto-z-1323027/review">Moto Z</a>. It&#x2019;s lighter, too, shedding off nearly 20 grams from its weight.</p><p>For all that has changed, there are some familiar pieces here. First off, the design isn&#x2019;t totally brand new, but the edges have been smoothed over compared to the striking edges of last year&#x2019;s model. It also keeps the 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C port, which are good moves in our book.&#xA0;</p><h3>Key differences</h3><p>The Play variation of Moto&#x2019;s smartphones tend to signal that it&#x2019;s down to do just that: play, and usually for longer and harder than its flagship can. Oddly, Moto&#x2019;s move to slim down the new phone comes at the cost of slicing its predecessor&#x2019;s champion 3,510mAh battery down to 3,000mAh. It goes without saying that the Z2 Play probably won&#x2019;t deliver two-day battery life, but Moto promises 30 hours of use and we&#x2019;ll certainly be testing that out in the full review.</p><p>Next, the camera bump on its back might look familiar, but it contains an improved sensor that&#x2019;s capable of shooting photos with larger pixels. Despite the drop down from 16MP to 12MP, it now has a lower aperture value that should ideally lead to some better low-light photography chops than its predecessor.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re facing the screen head on, the new ovular fingerprint sensor on the front of the phone looks a lot like the one found on the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/moto-g5s-plus-uae">Moto G5S Plus</a>. So it makes sense that Moto is also bringing the one-button nav ability found in that budget phone to the Z2 Play. Activating this feature removes the on-screen navigation in favor of finger gestures that you can perform right on the sensor. It sound strange, but don&#x2019;t knock it until you try it!</p><p><img  id="dRnooK2LRpRfTckPnnZQc7" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dRnooK2LRpRfTckPnnZQc7.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><p>Of course, it wouldn&#x2019;t be a Moto Z phone unless it had Moto Mod compatibility. Thankfully, it does, and Moto is celebrating the phone&#x2019;s launch by showing off a few new mods: Moto&#x2019;s own TurboPower battery case, the Moto 360 camera and the Moto GamePad, which looks to turn the Moto Z2 Play into a Nintendo Switch-esque portable console for more authentic on-the-go gaming experiences.</p><p>We&apos;ll have the full review of the Moto Z2 Play up very soon, so stay tuned.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>We&apos;re not done with 2017 flagships just yet, because HTC is rumored to be about to unveil the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/htc-u11-plus-release-date-news-and-rumors">HTC U11 Plus</a> - that&apos;s the follow up to the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/htc-u11-review">HTC U11</a> that launched earlier in the year. A press event is scheduled for November 2, although there&apos;s some debate about whether or not we&apos;ll see the Plus then.</p><p>In the meantime, there&apos;s serial leakster <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks" target="_blank">Evan Blass</a>, who posted a host of HTC U11 Plus specs <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/921761852291502081" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> over the weekend. Some of them match up with what we&apos;ve already heard about the phone, but it&apos;s worth running through them anyway.</p><p>The headline feature is the 6-inch display, with an elongated 18:9 aspect ratio, following the trend that just about every smartphone manufacturer has joined in with this year. Under the hood there&apos;s a Snapdragon 835 and either 4GB or 6GB of RAM.</p><h3>All we need now is a launch date</h3><p>That&apos;s paired with either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, plus a memory card slot for you to add your own. The unit is going to be IP68 waterproofed and come carrying a 3,930mAh battery, which is impressively big for a consumer smartphone.</p><p>The 12-megapixel rear camera is going to come with an f/1.7 aperture, according to Blass, while Qualcomm&apos;s Quick Charging 3.0 is supported and you get the same extras as on the HTC U11 - Edge Sense for squeezing the sides of your phone to carry out certain actions and BoomSound for a higher-quality audio experience.</p><p>While Blass did include a link to the HTC event on November 2 in his specs list, a later tweet said that particular occasion will be used to launch the mid-range HTC U11 Life instead. Whatever happens, we&apos;ll bring you the HTC news as we get it, so you can make an informed decision <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-argos-black-friday-deals-2017">this holiday season</a>.</p><ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-argos-black-friday-deals-2017">Here are all the best Argos Black Friday deals for 2017</a></li></ul>]]>

            <description>Huawei boss Richard Yu says his company has a working prototype but there are still improvements to make.</description>

                <![CDATA[<p>2017 was the year when bezels were out and big screens were in - could 2018 be the year when everyone brings out a foldable phone? We&apos;ve already seen the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/zte-axon-m">ZTE Axon M</a>, featuring a dual display with a hinge, and it sounds like Huawei has something similar in the works for a potential 2018 launch.</p><p>The company&apos;s CEO Richard Yu <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/huawei-samsung-foldable-phone-mate-10-smartphone-apple/" target="_blank">told CNET</a> that Huawei already has a &quot;working sample&quot; that it&apos;s working on refining. Apparently it follows the blueprint set down by the Axon M, but the manufacturer&apos;s engineers are working on reducing the gap between the phone&apos;s two displays.</p><p>For the time being at least, it seems as though foldable phones will be two displays stitched together, but in the longer term we could see one seamless display that can bend in the middle. Yu says Huawei could launch its first foldable phone next year, but the timeline isn&apos;t set yet.</p><h3>The future is foldable</h3><p>In terms of looks and form factor, smartphones haven&apos;t changed all that much over the past decade, although the phones of 2017 certainly look better than their predecessors. Foldable technology could be just the hardware innovation that handset makers have been looking for.</p><p>Rumors of a foldable Samsung phone called <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsungs-foldable-galaxy-x-phone-could-arrive-later-this-year">the Galaxy X</a> have been swirling for years, and it sounds like 2018 might finally be the year when it sees the light of day. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/lg-patent-suggests-a-folding-phone-is-in-its-near-future">LG</a> and <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/the-first-folding-iphone-could-still-be-years-away">Apple</a> have also been tipped to launch something similar in the not too distant future.</p><p>It&apos;s certainly a massive engineering challenge to get this kind of technology working, and working well, but if the big companies can crack it then it&apos;s likely to lead to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/cyber-monday-2017-deals">a boost in sales</a>. As soon as Huawei makes anything official we will of course let you know, but in the meantime there&apos;s the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-mate-10">Huawei Mate 10</a> to consider.</p><ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/walmart-cyber-monday-deals-2017">Here are all the best deals you can pick up from Walmart on Cyber Monday 2017</a></li></ul>]]>

            <description>Rumors for the OnePlus 5T are growing, but will it happen this year and will it actually be called the OnePlus 6?</description>

                <![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: </strong><em>We&apos;ve now seen another image supposedly showing the OnePlus 5T, and once again it shows an almost bezel-free design.</em></p><p>Sitting safely in the top ten of our favorite smartphones right now, the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-5">OnePlus 5</a> is one of the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/20-best-mobile-phones-in-the-world-today-645440">best phones</a> you can buy at the moment... but that said, in some markets it&apos;s currently off sale.</p><p>On the official OnePlus website you can <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-5-is-out-of-stock-but-it-doesnt-mean-well-see-the-oneplus-6-soon">no longer buy the OnePlus 5</a>, which is particularly strange as the handset is less than six months old.</p><p>Why would OnePlus drop the phone from its range so early? We&apos;ve asked OnePlus, but we haven&apos;t heard back yet and rumor has it the OnePlus 5T may be just around the corner.</p><p>Last year the company revealed the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/oneplus-3-1323353/review">OnePlus 3</a> in June followed by a new replacement handset called the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-3t-review">OnePlus 3T</a> in November 2016.</p><p>Some are predicting the company may be ready to do the same with the OnePlus 5, so we&apos;ve put together all of the rumors and leaks we&apos;ve seen so far about the OnePlus 5T.</p><ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-6-what-we-want-to-see">OnePlus 6</a>: will this be the phone we see next year?</li></ul><h3>Cut to the chase</h3><ul ><li><strong>What is it?</strong> A new flagship phone from OnePlus</li><li><strong>When is it out? </strong>Possibly November 2017, but likely 2018 as the OnePlus 6</li><li><strong>What will it cost? </strong>Around the price of the OnePlus 5 at $479 (&#xA3;449, around AU$630)&#xA0;</li></ul><h3>OnePlus 5T release date and price</h3><ul ><li><strong>Some rumors point toward a November 2017 release date</strong></li><li><strong>We initially didn&apos;t expect a new OnePlus phone until June 2018</strong></li><li><strong>Likely costs less than most flagships at around $479 (&#xA3;449, around AU$630)&#xA0;</strong></li></ul><p><img  id="T87E5cZHooy6L4Nc8juPgc" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T87E5cZHooy6L4Nc8juPgc.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><p>Right, this is where it gets a little complicated. So, OnePlus released two phones last year with the OnePlus 3 in June and a follow-up handset called the OnePlus 3T in November.</p><p>The OnePlus 3T bumped the OnePlus 3 off of the company&apos;s official store, and some people are predicting the same thing will happen this year too.</p><p>One report from <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2017/10/09/exclusive-oneplus-5t-tall-6-inch-189-display/" target="_blank">GizmoChina</a> - from what the publication calls a reliable source who has been right 80% of the time - suggests the phone will be announced in November this year and released soon after.</p><p>We don&apos;t have any idea how much the OnePlus 5T is set to cost, but we&apos;d assume it would be a similar amount to the OnePlus 5 or perhaps even a little extra because of the improved spec.</p><p>The OnePlus launched at $479 (&#xA3;449, around AU$630)&#xA0;so we&apos;re hoping for it to be less than most flagship phones on the market right now.</p><h3>OnePlus 5T news and rumors</h3><p>Rumors for the OnePlus 5T aren&apos;t numerous right now and most of the information we&apos;ve seen has come from one source known to <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2017/10/09/exclusive-oneplus-5t-tall-6-inch-189-display/" target="_blank">GizmoChina</a>.</p><p>The site is confident in the anonymous source and the leak is quite extensive, suggesting the phone will come with a 2160 x 1080 resolution, 18:9 ratio 6-inch display. That would make the OnePlus 5T look a lot like the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-review">Samsung Galaxy S8</a> and <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-v30">LG V30</a> that we&apos;ve already seen launch this year.</p><p>The render below is supplied by the same source and shows how the 5T has super thin bezels. The source can&apos;t currently confirm whether it will have curved screen edges or not and there&apos;s no sign of what the phone looks like from the rear.</p><figure><p><img  id="bzwJ7EZzEvnup3o7sz5CH9" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzwJ7EZzEvnup3o7sz5CH9.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption>Source: GizmoChina</figcaption></figure><p>It&apos;s also important to note that this render looks identical to the Oppo F5 that leaked previously, but the source is adamant this is the OnePlus 5T and that it will look the same as the phone from OnePlus&apos;s parent company Oppo.</p><p>Another image has also <a href="http://www.slashleaks.com/l/oneplus-5t-leaked-press-render" target="_blank">leaked out</a>, this time a lower quality render showing the handset in black, sporting a seemingly identical design to the picture above.</p><figure><p><img  id="zJURwxXM7iibddLCcs2hVj" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJURwxXM7iibddLCcs2hVj.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption>Credit: Slashleaks</figcaption></figure><p>And hang on... <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/is-this-what-the-oneplus-5t-is-going-to-look-like">what have we here</a>? Yet another rendering recently leaked out to the web (below), showing some shrunken down bezels and a fingerprint sensor around the back of the device.</p><p>Again the source <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/is-this-what-the-oneplus-5t-is-going-to-look-like" target="_blank">is GizmoChina</a>, so most of these leaks seem to be coming from the same place.</p><p><img  id="mH7ZwLs3gQVWgAs9Qjx5tS" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mH7ZwLs3gQVWgAs9Qjx5tS.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><p>Other specs are relatively uncertain but we&apos;d expect it to be similar to the OnePlus 5. That means the OnePlus 5T will likely have two 16MP rear sensors, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, at least 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.</p><p>We&apos;d also expect the phone to launch with the latest version of Android, which would be <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/android-oreo-features-release-date">Android Oreo</a>.</p><ul ><li>Read our <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-5">OnePlus 5 review</a></li></ul><h3>Will the OnePlus 5T happen?</h3><p>It&apos;s very uncertain right now. The OnePlus 3T was a strange addition to the line-up in 2016 and felt like a one-off purely because Qualcomm had introduced a more stable chipset in the form of the Snapdragon 821 to replace the Snapdragon 820 that was inside the original OnePlus 3.</p><p>That was arguably the only major change inside the OnePlus 3T compared to the OnePlus 3, but this time around we&apos;ve seen rumors point to a much more upgraded OnePlus 5T when compared to the OnePlus 5.</p><p>Considering Qualcomm hasn&apos;t introduced a new flagship chipset yet, it may be that everything above is actually a very early leak of the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-6-what-we-want-to-see">OnePlus 6</a>. Only time will tell.</p><ul ><li>Will the OnePlus 5 be cheaper on <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017">Black Friday 2017</a>?</li></ul>]]>

            <description>Is OnePlus planning a new flagship phone launch before the end of the year? These pictures say yes.</description>

                <![CDATA[<p>Right now there&apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what OnePlus has planned for a successor to the OnePlus 5 - stocks of that phone are <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-5-is-out-of-stock-but-it-doesnt-mean-well-see-the-oneplus-6-soon">very low</a>, so does that mean we&apos;re going to see a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-5t-release-date-news-and-rumors">OnePlus 5T</a> soon? After all, OnePlus has done the minor upgrade trick before, with the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-3t-review">OnePlus 3T</a> bump last year.</p><p>Well, here&apos;s another little clue that the OnePlus 5T is on the way: renders of the phone leaked to Chinese social network Weibo and posted by <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2017/10/20/oneplus-5t-fresh-renders-reveals-full-screen-design/" target="_blank">GizmoChina</a>, an outlet that seems convinced that we are indeed going to see another OnePlus flagship this year.</p><p>As the images show, the update would enable OnePlus to join the thin bezel, 18:9 aspect ratio crowd along with the likes of LG, Samsung, Google and Apple. To make room for the massive new display, the fingerprint sensor gets pushed around the back - you can see it just above the OnePlus logo.</p><h3>The waiting game</h3><p>Apart from the new super-sized screen and the shifted fingerprint sensor, these new pictures don&apos;t tell us too much. It looks like the dual-camera system used on the back of the OnePlus 5 is again used here, and it&apos;s likely that the innards are going to be the same as well, led by the Snapdragon 835 CPU.</p><p>We haven&apos;t heard too much in the way of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-5t-release-date-news-and-rumors">speculation and rumors</a> so far about whether the OnePlus 5T is going to happen, and that makes us think that the Chinese manufacturer might wait until 2018 and jump straight to the OnePlus 6 - it&apos;s possible that these are pictures of next year&apos;s phone.</p><p>If you&apos;re thinking about <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/best-buy-cyber-monday-deals-2017">buying a smartphone</a> in the next few months though, it might be worth waiting to see if OnePlus has anything up its sleeve. The phone is likely to be launched in November, if it&apos;s coming at all.</p><ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/cyber-monday-uk-2017">Here&apos;s everything you need to know about Cyber Monday in the UK this year</a></li></ul>]]>

And looking to the future, there could be bad news ahead for buyers of the iPhone 8 &#x2013; users of this Apple handset could find themselves being overcharged a whopping &#xA3;46 a month after their fixed contract period is up.</p><p>The research also found that older customers were hit hardest &#x2013; Citizens Advice discovered that 23% of over-65s overpaid for more than a year, compared with 13% of people under 65.</p><h3>Clearer billing</h3><p>The organization is calling on mobile operators to automatically reduce phone bills when the contract period is up; it also wants operators to separate the cost of the handset from the cost of the network in phone bills.</p><p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: &#x201C;Some of the largest mobile phone providers are routinely overcharging their loyal customers. Mobile phones are now an essential part of modern life, but the way that the cost of handsets are hidden within some mobile phone contracts gives phone providers a way to exploit their customers.</p><p>&#x201C;Providers could make it much easier for consumers to compare prices by separating out the cost of handsets from the cost of services like data and minutes for all contracts, that way it would be much clearer what they&#x2019;re paying for. It&#x2019;s important that Ofcom and the government are prepared to protect consumers by making providers take these steps, if they do not do so themselves.&#x201D;</p><ul ><li>We&#x2019;ve highlighted the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/best-business-mobiles-in-the-uk-top-smartphones-for-work">top smartphones for work</a> in 2017</li></ul>]]>

            <description>Google teams up with HackerOne to offer a bounty program focused on reducing phishing and malicious code downloads.</description>

                <![CDATA[<p>Google is eager to clamp down on security flaws associated with some of the most high-profile apps in its Android library, so it&apos;s enlisting white-hat hackers as a part of the effort. Should you successfully find a bug in a qualifying app on Google Play, Google will pay you nifty $1,000 for your efforts.</p><p>Google is partnering with bug bounty service HackerOne for the project, which it calls the <a href="https://hackerone.com/googleplay" target="_blank"><u>Google Play Security Reward Program</u></a>. The worldwide program currently only applies to eight popular apps such as Duolingo, Snapchat, Tinder, Headspace and Alibaba, although Google&apos;s own suite of apps for Android qualify as well.</p><p>Apps currently only qualify for inclusion in the program if their developers get an invitation from Google, but in time the Mountain View, California company plans to roll out the service on an opt-in basis.</p><h3>Bug out</h3><p>Nor do all bugs qualify. At the moment, Google is only interested in finding flaws that enable remote code executions (RCEs) on Android 4.4 and above. In essence, that means it&apos;s looking for bugs that allow web pages to open in an app for the purpose of phishing, or flaws that allowed the download of malicious code and the possible infection of an Android device with a virus.</p><p>It&apos;s a not-so-subtle way of forcing Android app developers to get their acts together. You&apos;re not even supposed to contact Google if you find a bug; instead, you contact the developer of the app through a form provided by HackerOne, and then the developer contacts Google once it&apos;s released a patch for the bug. Only then will you see any cash.</p><p>Google already offers similar bounties for <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/google-offers-100-000-to-anyone-who-can-hack-a-chromebook-1316956"><u>Chromebooks</u></a> and Android proper, but this marks the first time that it&apos;s extended the service to developers who use its popular operating system.</p><ul ><li>You don&apos;t need to search hard to find the best <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017-usa">Black Friday 2017</a> guide (it&apos;s ours)</li></ul>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>There was a lot of love for the new <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/new-nokia-3310-2017-review">Nokia 3310</a> last year, but none of that came from the US, where the 2.5G phone didn&apos;t work on American networks.</p><p>Enter the Nokia 3310 3G. It&apos;s the faster version of the retro phone, and it works with GSM carriers, meaning AT&amp;T and T-Mobile (but not Verizon and Sprint).</p><p>That&apos;s great news if you want a long-lasting, durable phone that doesn&apos;t cost a lot and, maybe most importantly, plays Snake 2 on its 2.4-inch color screen.</p><h3>Release date and price around the world</h3><p>Nokia 3310 3G price in the US is $59.99, which is cheaper than any Android phone you&apos;ll find on sale, outside of a few <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-prime-phones-unlocked-cell-phones">Amazon Prime phone</a> deals.</p><p>It&apos;s already out in Australia for AU$89.95, as it was first announced there, and it&apos;s now <a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/home/products/nokia/3310.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>available in the UK for &#xA3;59.99</strong></a> SIM-free, slightly up from the 2.5G version.</p><p><img  id="L5LCabmEjC5sdayyAMETGm" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L5LCabmEjC5sdayyAMETGm.jpeg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><p>The official US release date is October 29, however, you can pre-order the phone right now through Best Buy. It&apos;s available in four colors: azure (blue), yellow, warm Red, and charcoal (dark gray).</p><p>Note: the Nokia 3310 3G battery won&apos;t last long as the 2.5G version due to that power-hungry 3G radio. It&apos;s standby time is still 27 days, but music playback is 40 hours and talk time is down to 6.5 hours.</p><p>So who&apos;s it for? It can act as a safe phone choice for traveling since it&apos;s so cheap, or a weekend-long concert since it&apos;s durable and lasts longer than a smartphone. Or it&apos;s the ideal burner phone for your <em>totally</em> legit business.</p><ul ><li><strong>Like cheap? </strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017-usa"><strong>Black Friday 2017</strong></a><strong></strong>and<strong></strong><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/cyber-monday-2017-deals"><strong>Cyber Monday deals</strong></a> are coming</li></ul>]]>

            <description>iPhone X supplies may initially be even tighter than previously thought, but production should ramp up quickly.</description>

                <![CDATA[<p>If you&#x2019;re hoping to snap up an <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x">iPhone X</a> there&#x2019;s good news and bad news. The good news is that according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo the worst remaining production problems (which apparently involved the flexible printed circuit boards for the antenna and wide-angle rear camera) have almost been overcome.</p><p>The bad news according to Kuo (as reported on by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/20/kgi-iphone-x-production-woes-ending/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>) is that the problems have taken long enough to resolve that Apple will probably only be able to ship 2-3 million iPhone X units ahead of launch, meaning that&#x2019;s all that could initially be available, so initial supplies may be even tighter than <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x-could-be-in-short-supply-with-face-id-to-blame">previously believed</a>.</p><p>And Kuo has also cut his shipment estimates for the fourth quarter down from 30-35 million to 25-30 million.</p><h3>On your marks...</h3><p>In other words, if you want any chance of getting an iPhone X on its November 3 release date you should try and get your order in the second pre-orders open on October 27.</p><p>However, with production problems supposedly mostly sorted the only hold-up now is apparently in certain suppliers ramping up capacity and churning iPhone X handsets out, which means that shortages shouldn&#x2019;t last too long. Kuo predicts that shipments will &#x201C;pick up markedly&#x201D; in the first quarter of 2018.</p><p>So if this is accurate then within a few months the iPhone X shouldn&#x2019;t be too tricky to get hold of. But if you&#x2019;ve got one on your Christmas list you might be in for a disappointment.</p><ul ><li>There&apos;ll be plenty of great tech readily available at low prices on <a href="http://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2017">Black Friday</a></li></ul>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>It&#x2019;s insane how people don&#x2019;t think &#xA0;to change their service plans, whether it&apos;s gas, electricity or their mobile phone.&#xA0;</p><p>And it probably shouldn&#x2019;t be a shock to me any more, but I&#x2019;m still astounded that people are still giving their money to a network for nothing.</p><p>So many people are effectively walking into the local high street store for their mobile phone provider, plopping &#xA3;20 on the counter, and walking out.</p><p>That&#x2019;s <em>exactly</em> what you&#x2019;re doing if you don&#x2019;t renegotiate your contract at the end of your fixed-term deal, and I&#x2019;ve told that to so many of my friends. They ask me what the best deal on the new phone they want is, I tell them to wait a month or two for the price to drop, and then ask when their current deal ended.</p><p>Often the response is &#x2018;Oh, about six months ago, but I didn&#x2019;t know which phone to go for&#x2019;. And the thing is it seems most people are still unaware that their contract is made up of two parts: a percentage of it pays for the phone in equal instalments, and the rest is the cost of data, minutes and texts.</p><p>It varies by phone and network, but if you&#x2019;re on a &#xA3;40 per month deal for the Samsung Galaxy S8, for example, you&#x2019;ll be paying around &#xA3;30 for the handset and &#xA3;10 per month for your data etc.</p><p>So when you&#x2019;re at the end of the two year contract, you don&#x2019;t owe anything for the phone and you&#x2019;re able to drop to whatever SIM-only tariff you want. That&#x2019;s the whole point of it.</p><p>But networks are allowed to keep the deal running in perpetuity, and that means the more expensive the phone you choose for, the more money you&#x2019;re literally gifting to the networks each month.</p><p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mobile-phones-charge-handset-already-paid-for-monthly-contract-a8010191.html"><u>A recent report from Citizens&#x2019; Advice</u></a> (CA) highlights how badly this is affecting the British public, with 36 per cent of phone users sticking with the same price per month even when their contract has expired.&#xA0;</p><p>That amounted to an average of &#xA3;22 per month being given to said phone providers for nothing, and rightly the group - backed by MPs - is calling for reform.</p><p>Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41679408"><u>told the BBC</u></a>: &quot;The cost of handsets are hidden within some mobile phone contracts giving phone providers a way to exploit their customers.</p><p>&quot;It is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for. It&apos;s especially concerning that older customers are more likely to be stung by this sharp practice.&quot;</p><p>Vodafone, EE and Three are the main culprits for this practice, with O2 leading the &#x2018;revolution&#x2019; a few years ago when it started O2 Refresh, where it split the cost of the handset and the tariff down when signing the deal, which was fairer for two reasons.</p><p>Firstly, when your contract has finished, your bill automatically halves. That&#x2019;s possibly not the best deal you can get, but if the customer is unaware (or too lazy) over how contracts work, this minimises the pain - and makes it clear the distinction between the elements that they&#x2019;re paying for.</p><p>The second part is one that might make the blood boil for some: if you cancel a contract early, you have to pay up the cost to terminate&#x2026; that&#x2019;s fairly standard in all walks of life.</p><p>But with the other networks, if you cancelled a &#xA3;40 a month deal - which includes both phone and data / minutes - you have to pay the full amount remaining, even though you&#x2019;ll never be able to use that allowance.</p><p>The Refresh plan means if you want to cancel, you&#x2019;ll only pay off the phone, and the allowances become irrelevant.</p><p>Other smaller networks are following the same example: Sky Mobile will automatically drop the price of your contract when the phone is paid off (although it can also frustratingly tie you in for 30 month deals) and lets you roll over data that you&#x2019;re forking out for if it&#x2019;s unused.</p><p>Hopefully the CA report will kick the other networks into offering the same thing - but if it doesn&#x2019;t, then it&#x2019;ll be down to <em>you</em> to get in touch and change your contract. It&#x2019;s understandable that this can be confusing - I had a friend who I explained this to and she still didn&#x2019;t change her tariff as she couldn&#x2019;t decide if she wanted the new iPhone or not - but you&#x2019;re the one in control, not the networks here.</p><ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/sim-only-deals">SIM only deals</a>: compare all the best deals from all the networks and resellers</li><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-phone-deals">Mobile phone deals</a>: our pick of the best deals on the newest phones</li></ul>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>The days when you had to buy a dedicated gaming rig and spend a load of cash for a quality gaming experience are long gone. Thanks to the iPhone (and iPod touch) and the App Store, you can get an excellent mobile gaming experience for just a few bucks (or quid, for that matter), or even less.</p><p>In fact, a lot of the games out there are free. But can you get great games for nothing at all, or is the &apos;free&apos; section of the App Store just a shoddy excuse to bombard you with in-app purchases?</p><p>The answer is, of course, both. The trick is finding the gems amongst the dross, and what follows are our picks of the bunch: our top free iPhone games, presented in no particular order, including both long-time classics and brilliant cutting-edge recent releases. We&apos;ve even included a VR game for you... aren&apos;t you lucky?</p><h3>New this week: Tappy Cat</h3><p><img  id="EZMtwS2HrPgfm3sQma7NvD" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZMtwS2HrPgfm3sQma7NvD.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/tappy-cat-rhythm-collector/id993494269?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Tappy Cat</u></a> is a rhythm action game, with you playing as a musical moggie. Your cat sits before a &#x2018;tree guitar&#x2019;, and notes head out from the middle of the screen along two rails. These must be tapped, held, or tapped along with another note, depending on their color.</p><p>This is routine for a rhythm action game, but it&#x2019;s the execution that makes Tappy Cat delightful. It feels perfectly tuned for iPhone (your thumbs can always reach the notes), and there&#x2019;s a cat-collection meta-game, rewarding you with new kitties when you totally nail a tune.</p><p>The only bum notes are a lives system (a video ad will give you five lives &#x2013; although there is also a $2.99/&#xA3;2.99/AU$4.49 endless lives IAP for those who want it), and the way in which a single major blunder ends your latest attempt at musical superstardom of the furry kind.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/flat-pack/id1206776375?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Flat Pack</u></a> wraps a two-dimensional platform game around three-dimensional shapes. You control a little flying creature tasked with collecting every side of a cube before finding a level&#x2019;s exit.</p><p>But figuring out where to head isn&#x2019;t straightforward, because in applying a 2D game world to 3D wall surfaces, you can end up facing a different way when entering a plane from a new direction.</p><p>Fortunately, the game has a gentle difficulty curve &#x2013; death means restarting a level, but not collecting cube parts you&#x2019;ve already found. And Flat Pack slowly introduces its new ideas, such as enemies defeated by smashing them from below.</p><p>Should you find the main game discombobulating, there&#x2019;s also an augmented reality mode, which has you walk around a puzzle with your iPhone. It&#x2019;s a weird but effective experience.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/memory-path/id1262844912?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Memory Path</u></a> is a simple memory test that showcases how polish and smart design can transform the most basic of concepts into an essential download.</p><p>Across 50 levels, you tap left or right to move along a path toward a goal. The twist is the path disappears shortly after you enter a level. Initially, remembering where to go isn&#x2019;t tough, but later levels are likely to find your adventurer regularly impaled before you finally succeed.</p><p>Levels complete, you&#x2019;ll feel fully trained for the endless modes. Random shuffles the order in which you tackle levels; and Race Path is all about speed &#x2013; how far you can get before the road ahead vanishes. Sharp isometric graphics, a gentle soundtrack, and unlockable characters further boost the game&#x2019;s longevity.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/power-hover-cruise/id1247412591?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Power Hover: Cruise</u></a> is three endless runners (well, <em>surfers</em>) for the price of one. It borrows the boss battle levels from the superb, beautiful <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/power-hover/id1034773723?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Power Hover</u></a>, and expands on them. You get to speed through a booby-trapped pyramid, avoid projectiles blasted your way by an angry machine you&#x2019;re chasing through a tunnel, and whirl around a track that snakes through the clouds.</p><p>This is a gorgeous game, with silky animation and minimal, but vibrant objects and scenery. The audio is excellent, too &#x2013; the rousing electronic soundtrack urging you on.</p><p>There are a couple of snags: games can abruptly end due to difficulty spikes, and the controls initially seem floaty. But we grew to love the inertia, which differentiates Power Hover: Cruise and makes it feel like you&#x2019;re surfing on air. As for the difficulty, spend time learning the hazards and mastering the game, and you&#x2019;ll soon be climbing the high score tables.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finger-smash/id1205324911?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Finger Smash</u></a> is more or less whack-a-mole with fruit - and a big ol&#x2019; dose of sudden death. You get a minute to dish out tappy destruction, divided up into seconds-long rounds.</p><p>In each case, you&#x2019;re briefly told what to smash, and set about tapping like a maniac. Hit the wrong object, and your game ends with a flaming skull taunting you. (Lasting the full minute is surprisingly tough.)</p><p>This is a simple high-score chaser, and so there&#x2019;s understandably not a lot of depth here. However, there are plenty of nice touches. The visuals have an old-school charm, and the music is suitably energetic.</p><p>But also, there&#x2019;s the way you can swipe through multiple items, the bomb that ominously appears during the final ten seconds, and varied alternate graphics sets if you feel the need to squish space invaders, fast food, or adorable cartoon robots. Great stuff.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/spin-addict/id1202928328?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Spin Addict</ins></a> is an endless runner set in a landscape of endless industrial cogs and sparks. You control a piece of metal you set spinning with a swipe, subsequently tapping to leap, and swiping downwards to flip the ground beneath you.</p><p>In the endless mode, played in portrait, you try to get as far as possible &#x2013; easier said than done when massive pieces of machinery regularly want to flatten you, and your power must be constantly replenished by grabbing golden targets.</p><p>There&#x2019;s also a 15-level challenge mode, which plays out in landscape. This is more about pathfinding &#x2013; getting to the end of each course intact, having collected as many gems as possible along the way. However you play, Spin Addict is a wonderful app with a properly premium feel (bar the inevitable ads, which can be removed for $0.99/99p/AU$1.49).</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/leap-on/id1234382160?ls=1&amp;mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Leap On!</ins></a> is an endless jumper with a sadistic streak &#x2013; at least as far as its bounding protagonist goes. The two-eyed ball is tied to a central spiked star by a huge piece of elastic. Whenever you hold the screen, the hero moves in a clockwise direction.</p><p>The snag is hitting the spiked star spells instant doom &#x2013; as does touching anything else that&#x2019;s black. At first, this mostly means jumping on white orbs, and avoiding the odd lurking blob, but before long, the star starts lobbing all manner of ball-killing stuff your way.</p><p>You can fight back by grabbing power ups and smashing the white bits of projectiles, while chasing dual high scores &#x2013; how many white orbs you hit, and your furthest distance from the star. Leap On! is admittedly a bit one note, but the pacy, chaotic gameplay very much appeals in short bursts.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/built-for-speed/id1164412054?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Built for Speed</ins></a> is a top-down racer with chunky old-school graphics, and a drag-and-drop track editor. Make a track and it&#x2019;s added to the pool the game randomly grabs from during its three-race mini-tours; other users are the opposition, with you racing their &#x2018;ghosts&#x2019;.</p><p>Handling&#x2019;s simple &#x2013; you steer left or right. Winning is largely about finding the racing line, not smacking into tires some idiot&#x2019;s left in the road, and not drifting too much.</p><p>Initially, though, the game&#x2019;s so sedate you wonder whether someone mistook an instruction to make it &#x201C;very 80s&#x201D; by having it seem like the cars are driven by octogenarians. But a few upgrades later and everything becomes nicely zippy.</p><p>The only real snag is the matchmaking doesn&#x2019;t always work, pitting you against pimped-out cars you&#x2019;ve no chance against. Still, even if you take a sound beating, another tour&#x2019;s only ever a few races a way.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/knight-saves-queen/id1173353216?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Knight Saves Queen</ins></a> is a turn-based puzzle game, based on a knight leaping about a chess board. He moves in a standard &#x2018;L&#x2019;, aiming to bump off every adversary on the board, before rescuing the queen.</p><p>Initially, he&#x2019;s only faced by pawns, but soon other pieces enter the fray, forcing you to carefully plan your path. Over time, allies also appear, allowing you to further manipulate the opposition, which takes pieces every chance it gets.</p><p>The bite-sized nature of the game combined with the smart puzzle design make it ideal freebie fare for mobile. We do, however, take exception at needing perfect runs on every level set to unlock the next &#x2013; unless, of course, you buy coins via IAP.</p><p>Still, if nothing else, this forces you to properly tackle every puzzle, rather than blaze through with the least amount of effort.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/flick-soccer-17/id1129755661?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Flick Soccer</ins></a> is all about scoring goals by booting a ball with your finger. It looks very smart, with fairly realistic visuals and nicely arcade-y ball movement. You can unleash pretty amazing shots as you aim for the targets, and occasionally bean a defender.</p><p>The game includes several alternate modes, providing a surprising amount of variation on the basic theme. There&#x2019;s a speed option that involves flicking at furious speed, and the tense sudden-death Specialist, which ends your go after three failed attempts to hit the target.</p><p>Rather more esoteric fare also lurks, demanding you repeatedly hit the crossbar, or smash panes of glass a crazy person has installed in the goalmouth.</p><p>Like real-world sport on the TV, Flick Soccer is a bit ad-infested. You can, though, remove ads with a one-off $0.99/99p/AU$1.99 IAP, or &#x2013; ironically &#x2013; turn them off for ten minutes by watching an ad.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/drop-wizard-tower/id1220936997?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Drop Wizard Tower</ins></a> is a superb mobile take on classic single-screen arcade platform games like Bubble Bobble. Your little wizard has been thrown in jail by the evil Shadow Order, and must ascend a tower over 50 levels to give his enemies a good &#x2018;wanding&#x2019; (or something.)</p><p>It&#x2019;s all very cute, with dinky pixelated enemies, varied level design (skiddy ice; disappearing platforms; watery bits in which you move slowly), and fast-paced boss battles against gargantuan foes.</p><p>Most importantly, it&#x2019;s very much designed for mobile. You auto-run left or right, and blast magic when landing on a platform. Said blasts temporarily stun roaming enemies, which can be booted away, becoming a whirling &#x2018;avalanche&#x2019; on colliding with cohorts.</p><p>The auto-running bit disarms at first &#x2013; in most similar games, the protagonist stays put unless you keep a direction button held. But once the mechanics click, Drop Wizard Tower cements itself as a little slice of magic on your iPhone.</p><p>This blast from the past (of PC gaming) masquerades as a racer, but often feels like you&#x2019;re hunting prey &#x2013; albeit while encased in a suit of speeding metal.</p><p>The freeform arenas find you in a dystopian future where people and cows blithely amble about while deranged drivers smash each other to bits. Victories arrive from completing enough laps, wrecking all your opponents, or mowing down every living thing in the vicinity.</p><p>In the 1990s, this was shocking to the point of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/carmageddon/id498240451?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Carmageddon</ins></a> being banned in some countries. Today, the lo-fi violence seems oddly quaint. But the game&#x2019;s tongue-in-cheek humor survives, sitting nicely alongside bouncy physics, madcap sort-of-racing, and deranged cops attempting to crush you into oblivion should you cross their path.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/one-tap-rally/id1226941641?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>One Tap Rally</ins></a> distills the top-down mobile racer into a one-thumb effort. Press the screen and you accelerate; let go and you slow down. In the nitros mode, you can also swipe upward for an extra burst of speed.</p><p>It feels a bit like slot-racing, but the tracks are organic and free-flowing, rather than rigid chunks of plastic. Learning each bend and straight is essential to get around without hitting the sides &#x2013; important because such collisions rob you of precious seconds.</p><p>You&#x2019;re also not alone &#x2013; One Tap Rally pits you against the online ghosts of other players. Each time you better your score, you improve your rank on the current track, ready to face tougher opponents. This affords an extra layer of depth to what was already an elegant, playable mobile racer.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/crazy-taxi/id553921725?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Crazy Taxi</ins></a> is a port of a popular and superb Dreamcast/arcade title from 1999. You belt around a videogame take on San Francisco, hurling yourself from massive hills, soaring through the air like only a crazy taxi can, and regularly smashing other traffic out of the way.</p><p>Given the &#x2018;taxi&#x2019; bit in the title, fares are important. Getting them where they want to go in good time replenishes the clock. Excite them and you&#x2019;re awarded bonuses. Go &#x2018;crashy&#x2019; rather than &#x2018;crazy&#x2019; and the fare will take their chances and leap out of your cab, leaving you without their cash.</p><p>Crazy Taxi looks crude, but still plays brilliantly, and even the touchscreen controls work very nicely. For free, you must be online to play, however &#x2013; a sole black mark in an otherwise fantastic port (and one you can remove with IAP).</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/yeah-bunny/id1219797995?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Yeah Bunny</ins></a> is an enjoyable platform game featuring a speeding rabbit, who blazes along in a cartoon world, collecting carrots, grabbing keys, and trying to not get impaled on the many spikes some irresponsible dolt has left lying about.</p><p>It&#x2019;s an auto-runner, so controls boil down to tapping the screen to jump at the most opportune moments. This nonetheless affords you plenty of control, such as double-jumping in mid-air for extra distance, or wall-jumping like a bunny ninja.</p><p>The game looks superb, with plenty of neat touches like the smoke trail behind the rabbit. And although it can be frustrating when the furry hero is spiked yet again, you can always continue your progress by watching an ad or dipping into your reserve of collected carrots.</p><p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/fish-trip/id1224067836?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Fish &amp; Trip</ins></a>, you command a single smiling fish, happily swimming in the ocean depths. Using your finger, you direct the fish towards eggs and other stragglers, the latter of which join you to gradually form a school. Unfortunately, everything else in the sea is hungry for a fish dinner.</p><p>At first, you&#x2019;ll spot spiky anemones and the occasional sluggish green fish with big teeth. But eventually, you&#x2019;ll be zig-zagging through claustrophobic seas, trying to find new friends to keep your school alive, and avoiding massive sharks that show up to the theme from Jaws.</p><p>It&#x2019;s all rather simple, and may eventually pall. But in the short term at least, Fish &amp; Trip is one of those wonderful and rare iPhone games pretty much guaranteed to plaster a smile on your face.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/topsoil/id1104709870?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Topsoil</ins></a>, like its subject matter of gardening, is something that only really works if you&#x2019;re willing to put in the investment. And that&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s a puzzler that&#x2019;s easy to grasp within seconds, but that rewards long-term play, as you slowly master new strategies to lengthen your games.</p><p>The board is a four-by-four grid, into which you add plants. Every four moves you can harvest a plant &#x2013; or group of adjacent plants &#x2013; which turns the soil. A reckless approach soon leaves you with non-contiguous chunks of land and no chance of removing loads of plants at once.</p><p>Even when planning ahead, the game&#x2019;s inherently random nature can rapidly end a game. But Topsoil&#x2019;s charm and gradual drip-feeding of new items to plant makes for a leisurely and enduring brain-teaser ideal for filling spare moments.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a lot going on in 3D racer <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/nascar-heat-mobile/id1180650155?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>NASCAR Heat Mobile</ins></a>. There&#x2019;s the racing bit, obviously, which is rather nicely done. You find yourself on an oval of tarmac, attempting to slipstream and weave your way to the checkered flag, avoiding a horrible pile-up along the way. It all looks rather smart, even if vehicle movement is occasionally suspect; the controls are simple and responsive too.</p><p>Away from the racing, you can delve into a meta-game of sorts, erecting buildings to generate resources that support your little race team&#x2019;s efforts. This can be a bit of a distraction, but adds depth to the game.</p><p>And while the entire package doesn&#x2019;t hold a candle to the madcap racing in the likes of Asphalt, it works nicely if you fancy speeding along in a manner that&#x2019;s a bit more grounded.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/rvlvr/id1134732916?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>rvlvr.</ins></a> is an easy game to dismiss. Despite the pleasant piano soundtrack and clear visuals, it doesn&#x2019;t seem like anything special. You get a bunch of interlocking circles with dots on, and must select and rotate them so the puzzle matches the image at the top of the screen. Easy!</p><p>Only rvlvr. is anything but. Once you&#x2019;ve blazed through the initial levels, everything becomes a mite more complicated. You end up staring at half a dozen or more rings with dots liberally sprinkled about, realizing one wrong move might wreck everything you&#x2019;ve to that point worked so hard for.</p><p>This mix of progression and challenge, alongside rvlvr&#x2019;s quiet elegance, will keep it rooted to your home screen. And that you can skip any of the 15,000(!) puzzle combinations is a nice touch, ensuring you won&#x2019;t remain stuck on a single test you can&#x2019;t get your head around.</p><p>There&#x2019;s ambition at the heart of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/full-of-stars/id1078612182?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Full of Stars</a>, which so easily could have been yet another run-of-the-mill tap-based survival game.</p><p>Much of your time is spent in space, tapping screen edges to deftly weave your ship through space debris. When possible, you scoop up stardust to charge up your weapons system and a hyperdrive that blasts you towards your destination at serious speed.</p><p>But Full of Stars is also a role-playing game of sorts, finding you immersed in a plot that puts humanity on the brink. Along with your deft arcade skills, you&#x2019;ll need to manage resources and make vital decisions to ensure your survival.</p><p>It can get repetitive, and the arcade sections are sometimes harsh, but Full of Stars is a commendable effort at trying something different &#x2013; a story-driven journey that demands both arcade and strategic smarts.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/swordigo/id499125840?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Swordigo</a> is a love letter to the classic side-scrolling platform adventures that blessed 16-bit consoles. You leap about platforms, slice up enemies with your trusty sword, and figure out how to solve simple puzzles, which open up new areas of the game and move the plot onwards.</p><p>The plot is, admittedly, nothing special &#x2013; you&#x2019;re embarking on the kind of perilous quest to keep evil at bay that typically afflicts videogame heroes. But everything else about Swordigo shines.</p><p>The virtual controls are surprisingly solid, the environments are pleasingly varied, and the pace ranges from pleasant quiet moments of solitude to intense boss battles you&#x2019;ll struggle to survive. All in all, then, a fitting tribute to those much-loved titles of old.</p><p>It appears we&#x2019;ve got to the stage where taping up boxes is considered a viable subject for an iOS game. Bizarrely, though, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/tape-it-up/id1147622827?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Tape it Up!</ins></a> appeals.</p><p>It takes place on an endless scrolling conveyor belt, with your little dispenser leaping from box to box as you swipe. It&#x2019;s easy to grasp, but tough to survive when everything&#x2019;s moving at breakneck speed.</p><p>Grab enough coins and you unlock rather more esoteric dispensers that give the game a surreal edge. You might end up sealing boxes with milk, while cows moo in the background, or controlling a little console-style dispenser while an exciting-looking shoot &#x2019;em up taunts you by playing itself below.</p><p>Ah well &#x2013; everyone knows taping up boxes is more fun than blowing up spaceships, right?</p><p>Playing football on your own can be dull &#x2013; that is, unless you&#x2019;re the sporty hero of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/footy-golf/id1201943062?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Footy Golf</ins></a>. As ever, scoring is the main aim &#x2013; and there&#x2019;s a goal to be found somewhere on each course. But along the way, you can also collect coins someone&#x2019;s generously left lying around.</p><p>The controls are straightforward (aim with a directional arrow and then let rip); much of the challenge comes in trying to maximize your star rating by reaching the goal using the fewest possible kicks. You&#x2019;ll also have to navigate increasingly complex courses as you move through a city, caverns, a factory, and a scorching desert.&#xA0;</p><p>The game&#x2019;s a bit ad-infested, with a mildly hateful level unlock mechanism that encourages grinding, but played in bite-sized chunks, it&#x2019;s definitely more &#x2018;match winner&#x2019; than &#x2018;own goal&#x2019;.</p><p>You know when a game&#x2019;s entire App Store description is &#x201C;an exciting new thumb-sport&#x201D; that you&#x2019;re probably not heading for a title with oodles of depth.</p><p>And so it proves to be with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/jelly-juggle/id1175902969?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Jelly Juggle</ins></a>, which is more or less a one-thumb take on Pong that you play by yourself.</p><p>Here, a little fish swims in a circle whenever you press the screen, aiming to keep a square jelly in play. If you don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s hard enough (and, frankly, it is &#x2013; this game&#x2019;s like juggling at speed), crabs eventually mosey on in to complicate matters, and new levels open up where you&#x2019;re juggling multiple jellies.</p><p>A simple title, then, but one with immediacy (given how simple it is to grasp) and relentless intensity. Plus, games are short enough that you can probably have several attempts to beat your high score while waiting in a queue at the grocery store.</p><p>It&#x2019;s always the way: there you are, a mage, supplying everything for your town&#x2019;s increasingly slovenly citizens, when the ruckus from a particularly rowdy party causes a beaker of something potent to fall into your cauldron, blowing up your tower and turning you into a living skeleton. A typical Friday, really.</p><p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/just-bones/id1195837246?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Just Bones</ins></a>, the skeleton appears to be in a kind of Groundhog Day scenario, collecting up his various parts across tiny 2D platform game worlds, before flinging himself into a portal and repeating the process somewhere new.</p><p>It&#x2019;s all very silly, but also a novel take on a platform game; and for those who like a challenge, there are some seriously tough speedrun targets to beat.</p><p>In this auto-running platformer, titular hero Yobot dodders about cavernous rooms within a robot manufacturing plant. Using his not-very-super powers of jumping and being able to stop a bit, you must help him to the exits, grabbing switches and keys along the way.</p><p>The stopping aspect of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/yobot-run/id1194549886?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Yobot Run</ins></a> is complicated by you only having limited stop power &#x2013; you can&#x2019;t just sit there for ages, waiting for a moving platform to be just so.</p><p>The result is a game where you&#x2019;re always anxiously searching for a route to the next waypoint, trying to avoid dying on one of the plant&#x2019;s many hazards.</p><p>(Although, frankly, someone needs to have a word with the architect, given the number of spikes the plant has, and the exits being on impossible to reach platforms.)</p><p>Although, at its core, this is a fairly standard lane-based survival game (swipe to avoid traffic; don&#x2019;t crash), <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/dashy-crashy/id558094294?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Dashy Crashy</ins></a> has loads going on underneath the surface. It&#x2019;s packed full of neat features, such as pile-ups, a gorgeous day/night cycle, and random events that involve maniacs hurtling along a lane, smashing everything out of their way.</p><p>It also cleverly adds value to mobile gaming&#x2019;s tendency to have you collect things. In Dashy Crashy, you&#x2019;re periodically awarded vehicles, but these often shake up how you play the game. For example, the cop car can collect massive donuts for bonus points, and an army jeep can call in tanks &#x2013; just like you wish you could when stuck in slow-moving traffic.</p><p>Flinging a plastic disc about isn&#x2019;t the most thrilling premise for a game, which is why it&#x2019;s a surprise <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/frisbee-forever-2/id528241232?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Frisbee Forever 2</ins></a> is so good. The game finds a little toy careening along rollercoaster-like pathways, darting inside buildings and tunnels, and soaring high above snow-covered mountains and erupting volcanos.</p><p>You simply dart left and right, keeping aloft by collecting stars, and avoiding hazards at all costs &#x2013; otherwise your Frisbee goes &#x2018;donk&#x2019; and falls sadly to the ground. Grab enough bling and you unlock new stages and Frisbees.</p><p>This game could have been a grindy disaster, but instead it&#x2019;s a treat. The visuals are superb &#x2013; bright and vibrant &#x2013; and the courses are smartly designed. And even if you fail, Frisbee Forever 2 lobs coins your way, rewarding any effort you put in.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pixel-craft-space-shooter/id1164236087?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Pixel Craft</ins></a> takes no prisoners. No sooner have you found your feet in your little auto-firing spaceship than hordes of aliens blow you into <em>so much</em> stardust.</p><p>Before long, you clock formations and foes, learn to dodge huge arrows fired by a massive space bow, figure out how to avoid kamikaze ships, and discover how to best an opponent that&#x2019;s apparently ambled in, lost from arcade classic Caterpillar. Then you face a massive boss and get blown up again.</p><p>It&#x2019;s staccato at first, then &#x2013; even grindy. But Pixel Craft has a sense of fun and urgency that makes it worth sticking with. The aesthetics and controls are impressive, and death always feels fair &#x2013; to be blamed on your fingers failing you.</p><p>But with perseverance comes collected bling and ship upgrades. Then you&#x2019;re the one dishing out lessons in lasery death!</p><p>(At least until you meet the next boss.)</p><p>Depending on your way of looking at things, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/narcissus/id1153362089?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Narcissus</ins></a> is either a weird platform game for one or an amusing 50-level leapy game for two.</p><p>The basics are essentially based on the game Canabalt &#x2013; Narcissus leaps from platform to platform, lest he fall down a gap and go splat. But if you recall your Greek mythology, Narcissus had a reflection; in this game, the reflection is visible on the screen.</p><p>The snag is the world in which the two characters jump isn&#x2019;t a mirror image. For the single player, this makes for a tough challenge, keeping track of two tiny leapers, who often need to jump at different times. With a friend, it&#x2019;s easier, so long as you don&#x2019;t hurl your iPhone at a mirror should one of you badly mis-time a jump.</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve played <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/super-dangerous-dungeons/id1006111149?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Super Dangerous Dungeons</ins></a>, you&#x2019;ll be well aware developer Jussi Simpanen knows how to make a cracking platform game. Even so, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/heart-star/id1159003700?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Heart Star</ins></a> is a disarmingly charming treat.</p><p>You aim to guide two friends to a goal in each of the 60 tiny single-screen levels. The chums are typically surrounded by platforms, spikes, and switches &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s before you consider the perilous drops into a bottomless void. Also, there&#x2019;s usually no obvious way for both to reach the goal.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a head-scratcher until you start utilizing Heart Star&#x2019;s world-swapping. Prod a button to switch character, whereupon the other friend&#x2019;s platforms vanish. With a combination of brainpower, deft finger-work, and having the friends collaborate &#x2013; often by one hopping on the other&#x2019;s head &#x2013; a solution should present itself, allowing you to continue on your journey.</p><p>It&#x2019;s another vertically-scrolling endless survival game, where you&#x2019;re pursued by a world-eating evil, but <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/remedy-rush/id1187680401?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Remedy Rush</ins></a> is novel in subject matter and the way in which it plays.</p><p>The basics are familiar: you direct the protagonist by swiping about, aiming to keep ahead of your inevitable demise for as long as possible. But in Remedy Rush, you play as an experimental remedy (such as a cookie or sunglasses) exploring a grid-like infected body.</p><p>As you scoot about, toxins are destroyed to open up pathways, and health bursts can be collected to take out any cells and germs that are in your way. Over time, the host gets sicker and the fever more ferocious; when the end comes, you can try again with a new remedy, each one having its own game-altering side-effect.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/king-rabbit/id1073389796?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>King Rabbit</ins></a> has some unorthodox enemies. Having kidnapped his rabbit subjects, said foes have dotted them about grid-based worlds they&#x2019;ve filled with meticulously designed traps.</p><p>Mostly, this one is a think-ahead puzzler, with loads of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban" target="_blank"><ins>Sokoban-style</ins></a> box sliding. But instead of being purely turn-based fare, King Rabbit adds tense swipe-based arcade sections, with you running from scary creatures armed with rabbit-filleting weaponry.</p><p>Really, this isn&#x2019;t anything you won&#x2019;t have seen before, but King Rabbit rules through its execution. Visually, everything&#x2019;s very smart, from the clear, colorful backgrounds to the wonderfully animated hero (and the little jig he does on rescuing a chum). But the puzzles are the real heroes, offering a perfect balance of immediacy and brain-scratching.</p><p>This one&#x2019;s not freaky, nor is it even a racing game - so, sorry for luring you in with that. Instead, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/freaky-racing/id1185910919?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Freaky Racing</ins></a> is an endless runner of sorts. With visuals that appear to have lumbered in from 1981, the game has you steer a blocky black car along a vertically scrolling track. The problem is, you haven&#x2019;t got any brakes &#x2013; and things speed up <em>really</em> quickly.</p><p>Before long, you&#x2019;re weaving through chicanes, avoiding your doddering racing chums, and trying to avoid going near the road edges, which are apparently made from some kind of material that makes cars instantly explode. Chances are, you won&#x2019;t last long in Freaky Racing&#x2019;s strange little world, but it&#x2019;s a weirdly compelling title that&#x2019;ll keep you coming back for more.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a bit of cheating going on in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moveless-chess/id1150283105?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Moveless Chess</ins></a>. Although your opponent plays a standard game, you&#x2019;re some kind of wizard and apparently don&#x2019;t want the hassle of moving pieces.</p><p>Instead, you&#x2019;ve limited action points, which are used to transform pieces you already have on the board. (So, for example, with three points, you can cunningly change a pawn into a knight.) The aim remains a game-winning checkmate, and, presumably, avoiding the ire of your non-magic opponent.</p><p>It&#x2019;s chess as a puzzler, then, and with a twist that&#x2019;ll even make veterans of the game stop and think about how to proceed at any given moment.</p><p>After all, when you get deep into the game&#x2019;s challenges, you might find wizarding powers don&#x2019;t always make for a swift win when you can&#x2019;t move your pieces.</p><p>We&#x2019;re sort of in Crossy Road territory here, but instead of a chicken hopping along an endless landscape of roads and rivers, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/redungeon/id1119569595?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Redungeon</ins></a> finds a little knight dumped in a seemingly infinite dungeon full of traps.</p><p>Credit to whoever wanted to make the knight suffer, because said traps include endless inventive ways to kill someone, from squelching blobs of goo to massive metal panels that slam together, squashing flat anyone daft enough to get in their way.</p><p>As ever, you&#x2019;re being chased by some kind of unrelenting evil (here depicted by loads of spooky red eyes) and so can&#x2019;t hang about.</p><p>As such, you&#x2019;ll mostly fail by swiping the wrong way when in a panic, thereby impaling your knight. Still, grab enough bling on your journey and you can upgrade your character (and unlock new ones), giving them a fighting chance &#x2013; well, at least an extra 30 seconds.</p><p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/icarus-a-stars-journey/id1174729560?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Icarus &#x2013; A Star&#x2019;s Journey</ins></a>, you help a fallen star get back to the heavens. To make each little leap upwards, you drag back and release to catapult the star, like a celestial Angry Bird. Over time, energy is used, your star eventually exploding; to avoid that, you temporarily lurk inside other stars for a quick top up.</p><p>Much of the challenge involves successfully navigating hazards &#x2013; usually spinning shapes you awkwardly ricochet off of &#x2013; before you burn through your health.</p><p>Grab enough orbs along the way and you can lengthen subsequent attempts through leveling up and gaining extra health. If only you could burn through the ads, too, since they obliterate the tranquil vibe &#x2013; but, inexplicably, there&#x2019;s no IAP for that.</p><p>Given Laser Dog&#x2019;s tendency to make infuriatingly difficult games, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/dont-grind/id1155162058?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Don&#x2019;t Grind</ins></a> at first seems like a departure. You control a little cartoon banana, keeping it in the air &#x2013; and away from massive saw blades &#x2013; by tapping the screen and swiping to move a bit. It&#x2019;s like a pleasant keepie-uppie effort &#x2013; for a few seconds.</p><p>After that point, all hell breaks loose, with your worried-looking fruit having to escape a squishy, painful death by avoiding laser guns, rockets, and all manner of other hazards intent on shoving it towards the blades.</p><p>Collect enough stars while tapping the screen and you can unlock new victims. If you&#x2019;re terrible, there are no shortcuts to bolster your collection either &#x2013; the only IAP is to get rid of the ads. Brutal.</p><p>With eye-searing colors and jagged pixels, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/tomb-of-the-mask/id1057889290?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Tomb of the Mask</ins></a> looks like it&#x2019;s escaped from a ZX Spectrum, but this fast-paced twitch maze game is very much a modern mobile effort. In a sense, it feels a bit like a speeded-up and flattened Pac-Man 256, with you zooming through a maze, eating dots, and outrunning an all-devouring evil.</p><p>But the controls here are key &#x2013; a flick hurls you in that direction until something makes you stop. Hopefully, that&#x2019;s a wall. If it&#x2019;s a spike or an enemy, you&#x2019;re dead.</p><p>The procedurally generated Arcade mode increasingly ramps up the intensity as you strive to reach the end of each tomb, while a stage-based mode pits your flicking finger against 60 deviously designed set challenges.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re a fan of knocking metal balls about, you&#x2019;re likely frustrated with iPhone pinball. Even an iPhone Plus&#x2019;s display is a bit too small, resulting in a fiddly experience replete with eye strain. Enter <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/pinout!/id1108417718?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>PinOut!</ins></a>, which rethinks pinball in a manner that works perfectly on the smaller screen.</p><p>In PinOut&#x2019;s neon-infused world, you play against the clock, hitting ramps to send your ball further along what&#x2019;s apparently the world&#x2019;s longest pinball table. Rather than losing a ball should it end up behind the flippers, you merely waste vital seconds getting back to where you were. When the clock runs out: game over.</p><p>The result is exciting and fresh, and the relatively simple mini-tables are ideal for iPhone. Moreover, the game&#x2019;s immediacy makes it suitable for all gamers, overcoming pinball&#x2019;s somewhat inaccessible nature.</p><p>One of those games happy to repeatedly punch you in the face, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nekosan/id1148979232?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Nekosan</ins></a> is a brutal single-screen platformer. The premise is that the mice have stolen all the stars, and hidden them in a dungeon. It&#x2019;s up to the heroic Nekosan to retrieve them.</p><p>The snag is that, unlike most platform games, Nekosan only affords you control by way of tapping anywhere on the screen. Depending on where the kittie&#x2019;s positioned, said tappage might fling him into the air, have him leap from a wall, or help him bound on a mid-air switch.</p><p>You must therefore figure out how to traverse each puzzle-like level, using perfect timing to ensure the jumping feline isn&#x2019;t killed. And while you do, suitably, get nine lives, you&#x2019;ll find they disappear extremely rapidly.</p><p>At a glance, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-cat-tales/id1140495295?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Super Cat Tales</ins></a> looks like it&#x2019;s arrived from a 1980s console. Bright colors, chunky pixels, and leapy gameplay put you in mind of a Mario or Alex Kidd adventure.</p><p>But although Super Cat Tales twangs the odd nostalgia gland, the controls make it a thoroughly modern affair. Character movement happens by tapping the left or right screen edge - hold to move or double-tap to dash. While dashing, your moggie will leap from a platform&#x2019;s edge; and if sliding down a wall, a tap in the opposite direction performs a wall jump.</p><p>At first, this feels confusing, as muscle memory fights these unique controls. Before long, though, this smart design dovetails with succinct levels packed with secrets, collectible cats with distinct abilities, and gorgeous aesthetics, to make for one of the best games of its type on mobile.</p><p>The Mikey series has evolved with every entry. Initially a speedrun-oriented stripped-back Mario, it then gained swinging by way of grappling hooks, before ditching traditional controls entirely, strapping jet boots to Mikey in a kind of Flappy Bird with class.</p><p>With <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mikey-jumps/id1004729170?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Mikey Jumps</ins></a>, the series has its biggest shift yet. Scrolling levels are dispensed with, in favor of quick-fire single-screen efforts. Now, Mikey auto-runs, and you tap the screen to time jumps so he doesn&#x2019;t end up impaled on a spike or plummet to his death.</p><p>It sounds reductive, but the result is superb. Devoid of cruft and intensely focused, Mikey Jumps is perfect for mobile play, makes nods to previous entries in the series (with hooks and boots peppered about) and has excellent level design that sits <em>just</em> on the right side of infuriatingly tough.</p><p>Minimal arcade game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/higher-higher/id1141304181" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Higher Higher!</ins></a> is another of those titles that on paper seems ridiculously simple, but in reality could result in your thumb and brain having a nasty falling out.</p><p>A little square scoots back and forth across the screen, changing color whenever it hits the edge and reverses direction. Your aim is to tap a matching colored column when the square passes over it.</p><p>The snag is that the square then changes color again; furthermore, the columns all change color when the square hits a screen edge.</p><p>To add to your troubles, Higher Higher! regularly speeds up, too, thereby transforming into a high-octane dexterity and reactions test. Combos are the key to the highest scores and, as ever, one mistake spells game over.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/satellina-zero/id1086476832?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Satellina Zero</ins></a> is a somewhat abstract game that borrows from endless runners and rhythm action titles. You play as a white hexagon, sliding left to right to scoop up green hexagons streaming in from the top. You can also tap, which jumps you to the relative horizontal location while simultaneously switching deadly red hexagons to green (and greens to red). It sounds complicated, but it really isn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Survival is reliant on observation and quick thinking, where you must constantly ensure whatever hexagons are coming up are the right color, jump across at the perfect moment, and slide to scoop them all up. Last long enough and you unlock new modes and music.</p><p>It would have been interesting to see choreographed levels with percentage scores, rather than games comprising semi-randomized waves that always end on a single missed hexagon; nevertheless, Satellina Zero is a fresh, compelling arcade experience.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/blokout/id980806979?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Blokout</ins></a> is a furious, high-speed color-matching game that punishes you for the slightest hesitation. The initial mode plonks you in front of a three-by-three grid, and you have to swap colored squares, Bejewelled-style, to make complete lines, which then vanish.</p><p>The timer is the key to the game. A clock sits in the upper-left of the screen and rapidly counts down, giving you only a few moments to complete a line. If the timer runs dry it&apos;s game over; make a line and it resets, giving you another few seconds.</p><p>The intensity is therefore always set to maximum, nicely contrasting with the game&apos;s friendly, bold colors (which amusingly turn stark black and white the instant you lose); and if you stick around, you&apos;ll find further challenges by way of boosters and tougher modes.<br>
&#xA0;</p><p>There are few arcade games as refined and perfectly considered as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/forget-me-not/id419572408?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Forget-Me-Not</ins></a> &#x2013; and we&apos;re talking across all platforms, not just iPhone.</p><p>The game places you in procedurally generated dungeons, tasking you with eating all the flowers, grabbing a key and making for the exit. All the while, you auto-shoot ahead, blasting away at each dungeon&apos;s denizens.</p><p>What sets the game apart from its contemporaries is its energy, vitality and variety. Multiple modes shake up strategies, and the many different foes that beam in have distinct personalities to keep the gameplay varied.</p><p>Some relentlessly home in on you, whereas others are content blowing anything around them to pieces &#x2013; including the maze. Suitable for one-thumb play in portrait or landscape, Forget-Me-Not is an arcade classic.</p><p>Aptly named, given that it has loads of platforms and aims to make you panic, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/platform-panic/id940103464?mt=8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><ins>Platform Panic</ins></a> is a high-speed single-screen platform game. Whenever you enter a new screen, you’ve a split second to work out what’s going on before you forge ahead, trying to beat its various traps. As is so often the way on mobile gaming titles, a single slip up spells death.</p><p>There’s auto-runner DNA in Platform Panic, since your little character never stops running – although you can change their direction with a swipe and, crucially, leap into the air. Over many games, you’ll figure out how to beat each screen, and then it’s just a question of chaining together a number of successful attempts.</p><p>This is easier said than done, mind. Scores of over a dozen are something to be proud of in Platform Panic’s world. Still, games are short enough that when your little cartoon avatar is rudely impaled, there’s always time for another go.</p><p>One of the most absurdly generous deals we’ve ever seen on the iPhone, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/callys-caves-3/id940192022?mt=8" rel="nofollow"><ins>Cally’s Caves 3</ins></a> is a monstrous platform adventure that’s given away entirely for free. Many dozens of levels across eight zones find the titular Cally searching for her parents, who’ve managed to get kidnapped by an evil genius – for the third time.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Cally’s not overly chuffed with this turn of events, and she also happens to be worryingly heavily armed for a young pigtailed girl. She leaps about, blasting enemies, finding bling, and making for an exit, in tried-and-tested platforming fashion.</p><p>This is a tough game. Although you can have endless cracks at any given level, Cally’s Caves 3 is based around checkpoints, forcing you to not just blunder ahead. But smart level design and a brilliant weapon upgrade model keep the frustration to a minimum and ensure this is one of the best games of its type on the iPhone.</p><p>Apparently turned off by chess’s commitment to beauty, elegance and balance, the developer of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/really-bad-chess/id1109751921?mt=8" rel="nofollow"><ins>Really Bad Chess</ins></a> set out to break it. You therefore start your first game with a seriously souped-up set of pieces: several queens, and loads of knights. Your hapless computer opponent can only look on while lumbered with a suspicious number of pawns.</p><p>One easy win later and you’re full of confidence, but Really Bad Chess keeps switching things up. Rather than the AI getting better or worse, the game changes the balance of your set-up. As you improve, your pieces get worse and the computer’s get better, until you’re the one fending off an overpowered opponent.</p><p>It’s a small twist on the chess formula, to be sure, but one that opens up many new ways of playing, whether you’re a grandmaster or a relative novice.</p><p>In <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/maximum-car/id1049257954" rel="nofollow"><ins>Maximum Car</ins></a>, you careen along winding roads, smashing your chunky car into other similarly Lego-like vehicles. When possible, you lob missiles about with merry abandon, boost, drift, and generally barrel along like a lunatic. It’s a bit like a stripped-down Burnout or a gleefully violent OutRun.</p><p>Your terrorising of other road users (through near misses and blithely driving on the wrong side of the road), rewards you with coins to spend on powering up your ride. Do so and Maximum Car speeds up significantly, veering into absurd and barely controllable territory.</p><p>Takedowns (as in, smashing other cars off of the road) are also positively encouraged; destroy the same car over enough races and it’ll be unlocked for purchase.</p><p>Along with a tongue-in-cheek commentary track, this is all very silly entertainment – great for quick bursts of adrenaline-fuelled racing, and absolutely not the sort of thing to play before a driving test.</p><p>This third entry in the Dots series, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/dots-co/id1100331256?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Dots & Co</a>, will be familiar to anyone who's played the previous efforts. The aim is to collect a pre-set number of colored dots on each level, which is achieved by dragging out paths through dots of the same color. Manage to draw a square and all dots of the relevant color vanish.</p><p>Complications come by way of odd-shaped levels that often leave you with small groups of dots stranded within awkward shapes, and obstacles that need clearing. Cartoon 'companions' help a bit here, blasting away at the board once you've powered them up, and there are also a few special powers to make use of.</p><p>It's here the charms of Dots & Co fade slightly – as the game progresses, you can't help but feel you're being given impossible tasks, and that an awful lot of luck is required to beat levels without resorting to buying tokens to spend on powers or extra moves. Despite this, Dots & Co remains a pleasant and engaging time sink.</p><p>They don't come much simpler than <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/kubix-catch-white-squares/id914256167?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Kubix</a>, which sums up the aim of the game in what follows the hyphen in its full App Store name: 'Catch the white squares and avoid the black ones'. There is, fortunately, a bit more to it than that. As you're tilting your device to sneak past black squares and scoop up white ones the latter add to an ever-depleting energy reserve.</p><p>You'll also regularly see squares with a question mark barging their way into the arena. Catch one when it's white and you'll get a nice surprise, such as all of the squares temporarily turning white. Grab one when it's black and you'll be in for a nasty time, trying to survive in a sea of black squares, or avoid such pixels of evil while piloting a suddenly awkwardly unwieldy white circle.</p><p>Two games in one, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/big-bang-racing/id1048896882?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Big Bang Racing</a> offers a breezy single-player trials experience on trap-filled larger-than-life tracks, and then multiplayer races across similarly crazy courses. The visuals are very smart, with your odd little alien rider imbued with plenty of personality; the controls work well, too, with two pairs of buttons for moving and rotating your bike.</p><p>The game's infested with the usual trappings of modern freemium titles &ndash; chests; timers; in-game gold; in-app purchases &ndash; but, surprisingly, this doesn't make much difference nor really impact negatively on the experience. With a little patience, you can play a few races every day, gradually improving your bike, winning races, and mastering courses.</p><p>Collect enough bits and bobs from chests and you can even have a go at creating and sharing your own tracks, using an excellent built-in editor.</p><p>Poker and Solitaire have been smashed together before, in the excellent <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/sage-solitaire/id1004646445?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Sage Solitaire</a>, but <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/politaire/id1117343578?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Politaire</a> tries something new with the combination.</p><p>At all points, you can see the next three cards from the draw pile. You then swipe away unwanted cards from your hand with the aim of those remaining and any newcomers forming a poker hand, which then vanishes, automatically bringing in more new cards.</p><p>When possible, you want to score &apos;combos&apos;, through multiple hands subsequently occurring with you doing nothing at all. Naturally, this requires a little luck, but there&apos;s also plenty of skill here, in terms of managing your cards and figuring out what&apos;s coming in the pile.</p><p>It sounds confusing, but give it time and it&apos;ll dig into your very soul.</p><p>For free, you generously get the entire main single-deck game, which rapidly becomes furiously addictive.

But then you notice the smart level design, and the way in which you have to keep your little astronaut&apos;s speed up, lest they run out of oxygen. Sliding, jet-packs and wall-jumping are lobbed into the mix as the game flings increasingly complex caverns in your direction.

As it turns out, it's endless mazey hell for the yellow dot-muncher. Pac-Man's therefore charged with eating as many dots as possible, avoiding a seemingly infinite number of ghosts, while simultaneously outrunning the all-devouring glitch. Power-ups potentially extend Pac-Man's life, enabling you to gleefully take out lines of ghosts with a laser or obliterate them with a wandering tornado.</p><p>Although there's an energy system in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pac-man-256-endless-arcade/id1002340615?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Pac-Man 256</a>, it's reasonably generous: one credit for a game with power-ups, and one for the single continue; one credit refreshes every ten minutes, to a maximum of six, and you can always play without power-ups for free. If you don't like that, there's an IAP-based &pound;5.99/$7.99 permanent buy-out.</p><p>The endless rally game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cubed-rally-redline/id574202956?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Cubed Rally Redline</a> is devious. On the surface, it looks simple: move left or right in five clearly-defined lanes, and use the 'emergency time brake' to navigate tricky bits. But the brake needs time to recharge and the road soon becomes chock full of trees, cows, cruise liners and dinosaurs. And you thought your local motorway had problems!</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/dots-a-game-about-connecting/id632285588" rel="nofollow">Dots</a> looks and feels like the sort of thing Jony Ive might play on his downtime (well, ignoring the festive theme, which is probably more Scott Forstall's style). A stark regimented set of coloured dots awaits, and like-coloured ones can be joined, whereupon they disappear, enabling more to fall into the square well. The aim: clear as many as possible - with the largest combos you can muster - in 60 seconds.</p><p>In Smash Cops, you got to be the good guy, bringing down perps, mostly by ramming them into oblivion. Now in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/smash-bandits/id602403667" rel="nofollow">Smash Bandits</a> it's your chance to be a dangerous crim, hopping between vehicles and leaving a trail of destruction in your wake. The game also amusingly includes the A-Team van and a gadget known only as the Jibba Jabba. We love it when a plan comes together!</p><p>If you're of a certain vintage, you probably spent many hours playing Solitaire on a PC, success being rewarded by cards bouncing around the screen. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sage-solitaire/id1004646445?mt=8" rel="nofollow">Sage Solitaire</a>'s developer wondered why iOS solitaire games hadn't moved on in the intervening years, and decided to reinvent the genre. Here, then, you get a three-by-three grid and remove cards by using poker hands.</p><p>Additional strategy comes through limitations (hands must include cards from two rows; card piles are uneven) and potential aid (two 'trashes', one replenished after each successful hand; a starred multiplier suit). A few rounds in, you realise this game's deeper than it first appears. Beyond that, you'll be hooked. The single &pound;2.29/$2.99 IAP adds extra modes and kills the ads.</p>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>There are lots of things to be said about the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x">iPhone X</a>, but unavoidably one of those things is that with a starting price of $999 / &#xA3;999 / AU$1,579 it&#x2019;s very, very expensive.&#xA0;</p><p>However, if you wait until 2018&#x2019;s iPhone arrive you might be able to get the same features at a lower price.</p><p>According to unnamed supply chain sources speaking to Chinese site <a href="https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/2765497" target="_blank">Economic Daily</a>, Apple will launch a high-end handset codenamed &#x201C;Lisbon&#x201D; and a lower-end one known as &#x201C;Hangzhou&#x201D; in 2018, and both of these will include much of the technology from the iPhone X, such as its OLED screen and Face ID scanner.</p><ul ><li>Where will the iPhone X land on our list of <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/20-best-mobile-phones-in-the-world-today-645440">best phones?</a></li></ul><p>The reason for this is that Apple is apparently looking to boost its market share in China, where it currently sits at 17.7% according to <a href="http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/kantar-samsung-at-three-year-high-in-great-britain-apple-growth-up-in-us-2237025.htm" target="_blank">recent data</a>, trailing Huawei&#x2019;s 31.1%, and delivering lower cost phones without sacrificing too many features would, of course, help with that.</p><h3>It&apos;s still going to be expensive</h3><p>As for how much less the low-cost iPhone 9 (or whatever it launches as) will actually be, <a href="http://www.macotakara.jp/blog/rumor/entry-33595.html" target="_blank">Macotakara</a> speculates that it could be roughly 10,000 yen (around $90 / &#xA3;70 / AU$110) cheaper, so this would still be an expensive phone in that case, but more in line with other flagships.</p><p>This far ahead of launch we&#x2019;d be wary of any iPhone 9 or iPhone X2 rumors, so we wouldn&#x2019;t count on any of this being accurate, but with China being the world&#x2019;s largest smartphone market it would make sense for Apple to do what it can to make inroads there.</p><p>And given Apple wouldn&apos;t launch a country-specific handset (unlike HMD Global, with the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/nokia-7-is-design-led-phone-that-youll-probably-never-be-able-to-buy">Nokia 7</a>...) the rest of the world would be able to pick the new device up too.</p><ul ><li>Upgrading your slate?

                <![CDATA[<p>So you&apos;ve come to the end of your phone contract? You basically have two options - grab a brand new <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/mobile-phone-deals-1291413" target="_blank">mobile phone deal</a> on one of the latest and greatest smartphones on the market. Or keep your beloved phone of the last two years and sign up for one of the cheap SIM only deals on this page.<br><br>
A SIM only deal is a mobile phone plan that offers calls, texts and data in return for a monthly fee, but does not come bundled with a phone. Leaving the phone out of the equation gives you more flexibility (especially if you go for a 30-day rolling contract) or is ideal if you&apos;re eyeing up a new <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/sim-free-phones-deals">SIM-free phone</a>.</p><p>If you take a sift through our handy price comparison tool above you&apos;ll see that 12-month prices start from a mere <a href="https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21200399289&amp;a=103504&amp;m=6366&amp;clickref=trd-1685848919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&#xA3;4 per month for a basic plan</a>, while you can also still bag <a href="http://track.three.co.uk/ctv2/ar.aspx?aff_id=3713&amp;link_id=fc23325&amp;url=view%2Fplan%2FSIMOnlyD18092017T144430%3Fmanufacturer%3D%26deviceType%3DSIM_ONLY&amp;aidset=1&amp;link_ref=trd-2139081941" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Three&apos;s Mobile Choice Award winning 30GB for &#xA3;17 deal</a>. Whatever your needs, going SIM only is just the ticket if you&apos;re thinking to team one up with a brilliant <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017">Black Friday</a> handset purchase.</p><p>And if you&apos;re still unsure whether SIM-only is the route for you, our expert advice will help you decide - our all knowing FAQ includes tips on switching your number, the networks that offer free gifts and answers to a host of other questions.</p><h3>The best SIM only deals of the week are:</h3><p>We&apos;ve run the figures and plucked out the very best sim only deals available this month. &#xA0;Whether you&#x2019;re after the cheapest plan possible, want to dig out the best value big data SIM plan or just want an all-round great deal but don&#x2019;t know how much to spend, you&#x2019;ll find a recommendation just for you.</p><h3>1. The absolute cheapest SIM only deal out there</h3><a  href="https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21200399289&amp;a=103504&amp;m=6366&amp;clickref=trd-1685848919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="Ge8pMLePnap7quDjwUh47n" name="" caption="" alt="ID sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/173d759815a82c407124124e40cd25ed.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure></a><p><strong>iD Mobile | 1 month contract | 500MB data | 250 minutes | 5000 texts | &#xA3;4 per month</strong><br>
Phew! We&apos;re glad that didn&apos;t last long - a little glitch in the iD matrix reduced the data allowance on this deal down to 250MB for a while. This is the cheapest readily available SIM only deal currently available in the UK. If you just need to keep a phone up and running for occasional use, this is the least you can pay. You&apos;d be advised to either keep mobile data switched off or be careful what apps are updating in the background. BUT WAIT, CHECK OUT THE NEXT DEAL FIRST!</p><p><strong>View this </strong><a href="https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=21200399289&amp;a=103504&amp;m=6366&amp;clickref=trd-1685848919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>SIM only deal at iD/Carphone Warehouse</strong></a></p><p><img  id="U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>2.

If you&apos;re looking for a super cheap SIM only deal but don&apos;t want to limit yourself too much with data, 1GB for &#xA3;6 is the best option out there right now. You used to get 500MB more data with this tariff however, and a few pounds more a month gets you way more data if you keep scrolling down. This used to be a fiver, too - we wonder if iD is preparing itself for a big Black Friday assault...</p><p><strong>View this </strong><a href="https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=20438493503&amp;a=103504&amp;m=6366&amp;clickref=trd-90213372" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>SIM only deal at iD/Carphone Warehouse</strong></a></p><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" link="" align="" fullscreen=""></p><h3>3.

The only network we&apos;re seeing come close to Three&apos;s SIM-only pricing at the moment is Vodafone. That&apos;s thanks to some tremendous cashback offers from retailer e2save. For this tariff, &#xA3;99 cashback makes the effective monthly price only &#xA3;8.75 for 8GB of data. Superb, assuming you remember to redeem the cashback in five installments.</p><p><strong>View this </strong><a href="http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=422&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.e2save.com%2Fsim-only%2Fcontract%2Fvodafone%2FPay-Monthly-SIM-Card-on-Vodafone%3Fnetwork%3Dvodafone%26tariffcode%3DVH3VEAUG17&amp;clickref=trd-979502113" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>8GB Vodafone SIM only deal</strong></a><strong> available from e2save</strong></p><p><img  id="U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>5.

You can use your allowances abroad for free in 50 countries too! The only bind is that you have to submit a bill every couple of months to claim your cashback.

Sometimes EE pulls a SIM only deal out of the bag that really makes us stand back and take notice. This is a brilliant price for so much data, with the added benefits of buying directly from the network and getting the UK&apos;s very fastest 4G speeds. This is a cracker.</p><p><strong>View this </strong><a href="https://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=18595363019&amp;a=103504&amp;m=5571&amp;clickref=trd-1629945957" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>EE SIM only deal</strong></a></p><p><img  id="U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>9.

Since O2&apos;s Summer Sale ended on SIM only (so soon!), the network is nowhere near competing on the best SIM only prices. But if you&apos;ve got loyalty to O2 or like the idea of its Priority rewards for cheap lunches and first dibs on gig tickets, then this 10GB SIM is probably the best value plan. Just make sure you check out the best of the other networks first.</p><p><strong>View this </strong><a href="http://www.awin1.com/pclick.php?p=3604249419&amp;a=103504&amp;m=3235&amp;clickref=trd-387867437" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>SIM only deal from O2</strong></a></p><p><img  id="U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6D3ofXKriRQ8SrHtFkjL4.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><h3>10.

In fact, you&apos;re probably one of two people if your thoughts are indeed turning to SIM only:</p><ol ><li>You&apos;re coming to the end of your contract and your network is calling you a million times a day to get you to upgrade. Well if your phone is dying a death or you just fancy a change, head to our <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/mobile-phone-deals-1291413" target="_blank">best mobile phones deal page</a> to see what bargains are lurking, but otherwise going SIM only on your current phone is a no-brainer. You&apos;ll wind up paying much less than you are under contract, and you can stick to a rolling 30 day contract so that if your circumstances change, you can get out of the arrangement tout suite.<br><br></li><li>It&apos;s time for a shiny new smartphone and you want to get the best value humanly possible. You&apos;ll have to find a few hundred quid up front for the handset (be sure to check our <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/sim-free-phones-deals" target="_blank">SIM free comparison chart</a>) but box clever and you&apos;ll end up paying less over the next 24 months (see below). Plus, if you&apos;re a commitment-phobe, most SIM-only plans don&apos;t require you to sign up for two years like you would with a normal contract.</li></ol><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="cWa6GeFXBfDAQqfaZumGUm" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cWa6GeFXBfDAQqfaZumGUm.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure><h3>Is SIM only cheaper than contract?</h3><p>It can be. Teaming a SIM only plan with a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/sim-free-phones-deals">standalone SIM-free handset</a> could save you a few quid. It&apos;s usually the case when a flagship phone hits the market and contracts are made deliberately expensive. Take the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s8-deals" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S8</a> as a prime example, where you could have saved over &#xA3;100 over two years by splashing the &#xA3;800-odd for the handset and slipping in a cheap SIM card.</p><p>Not all the savings you can make are as extravagant, and on big data it&apos;s frequently more cost effective to dive into a contract instead. But if you can afford to splash a few hundred pounds up front then the savings over the next couple of years could well be worth it - especially if you can bag a bargain on <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017" target="_blank">Black Friday 2017</a>.</p><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="4aHHq3eyz6szHWufRCXLjF" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4aHHq3eyz6szHWufRCXLjF.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure><h3>Is my phone unlocked - can I use a new SIM in it?</h3><p>The times have passed since most phones were locked to a network and you had to pay a dodgy backstreet &apos;engineer&apos; to unlock it. Nowadays, it&apos;s standard practice for networks to let you use whatever SIM you want in the phone as soon as you&apos;ve paid up the original contract (or earlier if you pay them a fee) - and Three ships all its handsets unlocked from the outset.</p><p>The exception, alas, is Apple iPhones. They&apos;re generally sold locked to the original network that you purchase them with for the life of the handset. Very frustrating if you&apos;re looking for a tasty SIM only deal once your 24 month sentence is up.</p><p>The good news is that your iPhone (or any other mobile before the end of your contract) can be unlocked - the bad news is that most networks make you pay for the privilege. Insert a friend or family member&apos;s SIM into your phone to see whether it&apos;s already unlocked and, if it isn&apos;t, look for your network below to see how to cut ties with them:</p><ul ><li><strong>EE</strong> Once six months have gone by on your contract, you can call EE on 0800 956 6000 and pay them &#xA3;8.99 to unlock your phone. It says it will take around 10 days to complete. PAYG phones can be unlocked for free.</li><li><strong>O2</strong> As long as you don&apos;t own a Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8 Plus (they can&apos;t be unlocked until you&apos;ve paid off your contract), you can unlock any O2 phone - including iPhones - for free if you&apos;re on a pay monthly contract. PAYG customers have to pay &#xA3;15.</li><li><strong>Three</strong> Fear not, all phones on Three are unlocked as standard. Shove whatever SIM you like in there, it will work a treat.</li><li><strong>Vodafone </strong>The red network doesn&apos;t quite get the same marks as Three, as your phone will be locked to them on arrival. But they have made unlocking handsets absolutely free within 10 days of your request.</li></ul><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="" fullscreen=""></p><h3>What SIM card size do I need?</h3><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="s5Zt5M5pz7YGrKvN2XY698" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s5Zt5M5pz7YGrKvN2XY698.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure><p>There are three sizes of SIM card that you can get for your phone, and the one you need will depend on your handset. It&apos;s been a while since the traditional, so-called <strong>standard</strong> SIM (15x25mm) has genuinely been the staple in new phones. Instead, any phone you&apos;ve bought within the last five or so years is much more likely to require a<strong> micro </strong>(12x15mm) or <strong>nano </strong>(8.8x12.3mm) SIM - the iPhone 5 was Apple&apos;s first mobile with a nano SIM, while Samsung began using the smallest size in its Galaxy S6.</p><p>Before you purchase your new SIM, double-check the manufacturer&apos;s website to see what size you require. And if you&apos;re simply not sure, most networks now simply send out a <strong>triple </strong>SIM, so you&apos;ll get one of each size.</p><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="" fullscreen=""></p><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="arEKjroSWPQRCC4kwpFGQP" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/arEKjroSWPQRCC4kwpFGQP.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure><h3>How do I keep my old number?</h3><p>Ever heard of PAC codes and wondered what a classic 80s arcade game had to do with telephone numbers? It actually stands for Porting Authorisation Code, and it&apos;s the set of digits that you need to grab from your old network to let you transfer over your existing mobile number. If you&apos;re on one of the major networks, you can see what phone number you can contact them on here:</p><ul ><li><strong>EE</strong> 07953 966 250</li><li><strong>O2</strong> 0344 8090202</li><li><strong>Vodafone</strong> 03333 040 191</li><li><strong>Three</strong> 0333 300 3333</li><li><strong>ID</strong> 0333 003 7777</li><li><strong>GiffGaff </strong>43431 from your handset</li><li><strong>Virgin </strong>0345 6000 789</li><li><strong>BT</strong> 0800 800 150</li><li><strong>Tesco</strong> 0345 301 4455</li><li><strong>Sky</strong> 03300 412 524</li><li><strong>Asda</strong> 0800 079 2732</li></ul><p>If you want to grab a bargain SIM only plan above, but it&apos;s on your existing network then your network won&apos;t release a PAC code and you&apos;ll be forced to take a new phone number.</p><p>At least you would have, if it wasn&apos;t for this clever (if convoluted) work-around. You have to order a free pay-as-you-go SIM from another network. Once you have it, you can tell your old network that you&apos;re moving and they&apos;ll give you that precious PAC code. Then, once your number is registered to the substitute network, simply get another PAC code from them. Take that to your old network, and they&apos;ll move your number to your new contract. Simple - kind of!</p><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="" fullscreen=""></p><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="DNfeCrBDAE9DQcs2QTAkrV" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DNfeCrBDAE9DQcs2QTAkrV.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure><h3>What contract length should I get?</h3><p>Unlike with a contract, there&apos;s a lot more flexibility available when it comes to how long your SIM only plan will last. Two year commitments are virtually unheard of, with the norm being either one year or rolling one month contracts for ultimate flexibility. You can often get better prices if you tie yourself in for 12 months, especially on larger data tariffs. But sticking to one month at a time means that you can effectively hand pick a new plan to suit you every 30 days or so.</p><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="" fullscreen=""></p><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="vFJTZx2hn6e9bdmZJBiJgD" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vFJTZx2hn6e9bdmZJBiJgD.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure><h3>How much data do I need?</h3><p>Because you can change your plan up more regularly than a normal, lengthier contract, it&apos;s less crucial to get this nailed from the start. But if you&apos;re thinking of grabbing a 12-monther or just put a personal pride on getting things right first time, then we&apos;ll help you pick out the sweet spot of data for you.</p><p>Firstly, check your phone to see how much data you&apos;ve been using to date, and whether you have the tendency to use more than your current allowance every month. Then, if you&apos;re still unsure, check out our guidance:&#xA0;</p><ul ><li><strong>0-1GB</strong> Tiny amounts of data on SIM only deals could be a blessing or a curse. If you&apos;re putting it in a rarely used phone that will scarcely be away from wi-fi then you&apos;re quids in. But if you end up with one because your head&apos;s turned by the incredible price, then you could end up paying more if you continually go over your allowance.</li><li><strong>2-3GB</strong> For anybody who needs data for little more than the occasional Google Maps route planning, 2GB and 3GB plans come cheap and give you much more freedom to check the football scores and scroll Facebook away from the wi-fi without danger.</li><li><strong>4-8GB</strong> If you can&apos;t leave the house without having a music streaming service like Spotify pouring into your ears, then it might be worth paying for some extra GBs of data.</li><li><strong>10-16GB </strong>This is a significant amount of data and some networks offer it for a very appetising price. Whether streaming music, downloading podcasts, watching social media videos, or all three is your thing - you should be covered.</li><li><strong>20-30GB</strong> Only smartphone junkies that need regular (and hefty) data fixes need bother with this avalanche of GBs. You&apos;ll be able to rinse Netflix, Spotify and online games without too much fear of topping out.</li><li><strong>Unlimited</strong> Maybe it&apos;s because you use remarkable amounts of data. Maybe it&apos;s because you simply don&apos;t want to keep checking how much data you&apos;ve used every month. Whatever your reason to go unlimited, you have only two choices when it comes to network: Three or GiffGaff.</li></ul><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="" fullscreen=""></p><figure class=pull-left><p><img  id="LFFf5Gcm4RLqewi9USmrie" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LFFf5Gcm4RLqewi9USmrie.jpg" align="left" fullscreen="" class="pull-left"></p></figure><h3>Do I need unlimited calls and texts?</h3><p>Call it practicality, call it greediness, call it what you want - it&apos;s human nature to want &apos;unlimited&apos; anything if offered. But you should think genuinely about whether you really need it in a world where the likes of WhatsApp and Skype let you call and text for free over wi-fi or 4G. If you decide that a few thousand monthly minutes and texts should do you, then you could shave off some cash from your bill.</p><p><img  id="LjLSChGcLAPXe7bWyy6TkX" name="" caption="" alt="sim only deals" src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6055d9b3b185c0b87d5043eec55f7653.jpg" align="" fullscreen=""></p><h3>What&apos;s the best mobile network for SIM only?</h3><p>While EE, O2, Vodafone and Three are generally considered the major four networks for contract plans, when it comes to SIM only there are some other key players are well worth a look.

The cheap deals don&apos;t give you much of an allowance to play with, but if you just want to keep your phone going and available to use for calls and texts with the occasional bit of internet use outside of your home WiFi, GiffGaff is a strong offering.

Enter your postcode and you&apos;ll see whether your address has 2G (calls, texts and email), 3G (the basics plus picture messaging and faster web browsing) and 4G (all the powers of 3G, plus faster downloads, online gaming and media streaming) coverage.</p><p>We&apos;ve provided links below to all the available coverage checkers on multiple networks.

It&apos;s the Luke Skywalker of user interface elements.</p><p><a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/17/surprise-google-pixel-2-hidden-menu-button-navigation-bar/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Android Police</u></a> was the first outlet to uncover it, and through &apos;purely accidental means&apos; at that. To access it yourself, just click on the empty area to the right of the button for recent apps, close the corner of the screen, and an app-specific menu will (usually) pop up in all its glory.&#xA0;</p><p>It won&apos;t work with every app, though, likely as a consequence of the feature&apos;s absence from more recent apps &#x2013; because the menu button is absent from latter-day versions of Android itself.</p><figure><p><img  id="hgEUmdPQrD8caznVzEZBv6" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgEUmdPQrD8caznVzEZBv6.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption>Image credit: Android Police</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, its oddly hidden placement suggests it may have accidentally been left behind from a rough draft of the Pixel 2 operating system. The fact that it sometimes doesn&apos;t work at all without a few taps lends credence to this hypothesis.&#xA0;</p><p>Viewed in that light, its inclusion here is actually rather embarrassing. Now that the word&apos;s out, it&apos;s possible it may be not be long before we see an update from Google that removes it.</p><p>But, it&apos;s possibly accidental reappearance has reminded us of its usefulness. As <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/17/surprise-google-pixel-2-hidden-menu-button-navigation-bar/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>9to5Google</u></a> puts it, the subtly reincarnated menu button makes it easier to access features such as the share menu in the Chrome browser &apos;without any extra hand gymnastics.&apos; Removing it now would thus arguably mean stripping the Google Pixel 2 of a useful feature.</p><p>Only time will tell whether Google relents to or resists the popular demand. Meanwhile, enjoy it while it lasts &#x2013; if it&apos;s still around when Google&apos;s new phone officially launches on Thursday.</p><ul ><li>We&apos;re hoping beyond hope for some Pixel 2 deals this <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017-usa">Black Friday</a></li></ul>]]>

            <description>New 'Try It Now' feature lets Android users access Instant Apps directly from the Google Play storefront.</description>

                <![CDATA[<p>Sick of having to download apps before you can see what they&apos;re like? Google is helping to get rid of much of that hassle by adding a &quot;Try It Now&quot; option beside apps on its Google Play store, which allows you to use stripped-down, web-based versions of the app rather than having to download the whole shebang.&#xA0;</p><p>You&apos;ll basically be using a website, but to outward appearances it won&apos;t look or perform much differently than the app you otherwise would have downloaded.</p><p>The feature builds off of Google&apos;s &quot;Instant Apps&quot; feature the company first announced to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/android-instant-apps-kills-the-app-download-1321584"><u>much fanfare</u></a> at Google IO 2016. Google opened the development of Instant Apps late last May, but today marks the first time the service has been available straight from the Google Play storefront. Up until today, you had to use a <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/android-instant-apps-now-support-500-million-devices"><u>specialized app</u></a>.</p><a  target="_blank"><figure><p><img  id="aUqQQqpAcXEoYDC8CAgJVe" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUqQQqpAcXEoYDC8CAgJVe.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen="1" class="expandable"></p><figcaption>Here's what you can try right now</figcaption></figure></a><p>Despite all that lead time, the number of apps that support the feature is almost <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3002d0f_instantapps_featuredapps?e=-EnableAppDetailsPageRedesign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>laughably small</u></a>. At the time of writing, in fact, we found only eight, including favorites like the New York Times Crossword app or specialized apps for media like BuzzFeed News or Red Bull TV.&#xA0;</p><p>Based on these selections, it&apos;s probably wise to assume you won&apos;t be seeing this feature being used for, say, a 3GB mobile game.</p><p>But, the feature certainly has its uses, such as occasions when you might want to buy tickets through an app you&apos;ll only use once or twice. With Try It Now, you can make the purchase through the usually slick, intuitive app rather than through the often unreliable and cramped interface you often get on a mobile site.&#xA0;</p><ul ><li><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-black-friday-deals-2017">Amazon deals on Black Friday 2017</a> are sure to be steals</li></ul>]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Google only announced that it had secretly stuffed new, custom &quot;<a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/android-81-is-just-weeks-away-and-comes-with-a-pixel-2-hardware-upgrade"><u>Pixel Visual Core</u></a>&quot; chips into its new <a href="http://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-xl-review"><u>Pixel 2 XL</u></a> phones earlier this week, perhaps in expectation that someone like teardown iFixit was going to rip open the devices and find them anyway.&#xA0;</p><p>And, sure enough, iFixit&apos;s recently released <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Google+Pixel+2+XL+Teardown/98093" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>teardown</u></a> for the Google Pixel 2 XL reveals the powerful imaging-focused chip humbly packed in beside the familiar Snapdragon 835 processor.</p><p>It&apos;s not even currently activated. That&apos;s remarkable because our review of the Pixel 2 XL already praised the &quot;absolutely killer camera,&quot; and then Google surprised us with the news that it&apos;ll eventually get better with the Visual Core.<br><br>
Once the Visual Core goes live with Android 8.1 in the next few weeks, Google said in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-visual-core-image-processing-and-machine-learning-pixel-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><u>blog post</u></a> that you&apos;ll be able to take HDR+ photos five times faster and with one-tenth the power of the Snapdragon processor the Pixel 2 XL currently uses. That speed and efficiency comes with all kinds of perks, including better shots in dim light, better zoomed-in shots and crisper images in portrait mode.&#xA0;</p><p>You can see the chip in plain sight in the image below, marked with the label SR3HX X726C502.</p><figure><p><img  id="ZHEiU7kdWCMW38wku9btc3" name=""  src="http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZHEiU7kdWCMW38wku9btc3.jpg" align="middle" fullscreen=""></p><figcaption>Image credit: iFixit</figcaption></figure><p>The Visual Core is Google&apos;s first custom chip for the Pixel, and it clearly represents an effort to compete with Apple and its custom A-series chips for the iPhone.&#xA0;</p><p>As in the case of the A-series chips, the Pixel Visual Core is custom-designed to boost certain features above what you&apos;ll get with standardized processors, which in this case naturally means improvements for the camera that Google has made such a key aspect of the Pixel&apos;s appeal. In time, Google will also allow third-party developers access to the Pixel Core&apos;s HDR+ capabilities.</p><p>iFixit&apos;s teardown revealed few other surprises, but it&apos;s worth checking out for glimpses of the device&apos;s firm magnesium shell, its sensors for Active Edge and a new heat pipe that&apos;ll help cool the device once the Pixel Visual Core is running.</p><p>iFixit also knocked the Pixel 2 XL&apos;s repairability rating down by one point from last year to 6 out of 10, partly because of a stronger glue used for the device&apos;s battery.</p><ul ><li>See what great deals we expect on <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/black-friday-2017-usa">Black Friday 2017</a></li></ul>]]>
